## 2026-05-23 — Teen Camp FAQ, Day Plan And Tilda Loader Repair

- Trigger: a Timepad registrant asked whether the teen summer program is really for ages 12-19, whether the long day has lunch/breaks, whether parents must attend, and where the concrete plan is shown.
- Workstream: Moonn / teen psychology camp page `140348786`, branch `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Decisions:
  - Keep the Moonn page as the existing paid teen psychology camp contour and answer the objection there without changing payment provider/settings.
  - Add public-facing age, lunch/breaks, parent-presence and day-plan content; keep internal implementation notes out of visible text.
  - Publish through authenticated Google Chrome for Rublev/Tilda, not through an unauthenticated Tilda login window.
- Changed files:
  - `docs/teen-psychology-camp-2026/tilda-page-final.html`
  - `docs/teen-psychology-camp-2026/tilda-html-block-final.html`
  - `docs/teen-psychology-camp-2026/tilda-head-loader-final.html`

## 2026-05-23 — Moonn Teen Camp Offer Expansion From Competitor Benchmark

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Workstream: teen psychology camp Tilda page, conversion and parent-objection handling.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user compared the page with a competitor flyer/site and asked to strengthen the teen camp offer, including neural-network practice, trust, parent-facing answers and visual non-text-heavy presentation.
- Decision:
  - Use competitor structure as a benchmark, not copy: broaden the offer from "psychology sessions" to a practical teen camp experience with soft skills, mini-projects, city tasks, AI literacy, parent reassurance and clear outcomes.
  - Add neural-network practice only as an honest operational promise: participants use their own laptop if possible, and the block covers prompts, checking answers, mini-project ideas and digital safety.
- Changed files:
  - `docs/teen-psychology-camp-2026/tilda-page-final.html`
  - `docs/teen-psychology-camp-2026/tilda-html-block-final.html`
  - `docs/teen-psychology-camp-2026/tilda-head-loader-final.html`
- Live publication:
  - Saved exact page HEAD for Tilda page `140348786` in project `8326812` through the Alexander/Rublev Chrome window.
  - Published the Tilda page after HEAD save.
- Verification:
  - Raw live HTML returned HTTP `200`, contained commit `8c7debea81af22a73e618f9b84794693306190da` and loader version `20260523-offer-visual-ai`.
  - Raw live HTML did not contain old technical/public-copy regression strings or old native placeholder `Book design is the art`.
  - Browser DOM check reported `imgs=13/13 bad=0 miss=0 sections=7`.
  - Visual scroll-through confirmed the new neural-network section, parent reassurance section, five-day program, trust section and FAQ are visible.
- Live publication:
  - Saved exact page HEAD for Tilda page `140348786` in project `8326812` through the Alexander/Rublev Chrome window.
  - Published the Tilda page after HEAD save.
- Verification:
  - Raw live HTML returned HTTP `200`, contained commit `28492062999fe4696ec584ceb8c5f4dac1434768` and loader version `20260523-visual-copy-fix`.
  - Raw live HTML did not contain `Длинный день разбит`, `понятные блоки`, `Примерная логика`, `Мы обновили блок`, or old native placeholder `Book design is the art`.
  - Browser DOM check reported `imgs=8/8 bad=0 miss=0 invisible=0`.
  - Visual scroll-through confirmed the hero image, gallery images, daily rhythm block, and five-day program cards are visible.
- Live verification:
  - Tilda page-specific HEAD was replaced with the current teen camp loader and page `140348786` was published.
  - Browser DOM check on `https://moonn.ru/podrostkovyy-lager-psihologiya?qa=after-head-replace-20260523` confirmed: `12-19`, lunch/break text, parent-presence answer and day-plan text are visible; `Book design is the art`, `Html code will be here`, `Your Name`, `Your Email`, `Payment method`, `Checkout` are not visible.
- Incident / follow-up:
  - The first Tilda run used a non-authorized login window and failed to save HEAD. The corrected route used the already authorized Google Chrome profile.
  - The old five-page SEO runtime layer was still repainting the page after the camp loader. The page-specific HEAD was replaced instead of appended so the live DOM is controlled by the teen camp loader.
  - Raw Tilda HTML still contains legacy placeholder records and native cart labels below the loader; the rendered page is fixed, but a future stronger cleanup should replace/delete those native placeholder records in Tilda rather than relying only on the loader.

### Native Placeholder Cleanup

- Trigger: user approved removal of the old native Tilda placeholder records.
- Action: deleted native records `rec2251668081` (`Book design is the art`), `rec2250975141` (`About design thinking`) and `rec2250898451` (`Html code will be here`) in the Tilda editor, then republished page `140348786`.
- Boundary: preserved the native Tilda cart/payment record because it is required for the existing checkout flow.
- Verification:
  - Raw HTML check on `https://moonn.ru/podrostkovyy-lager-psihologiya?qa=raw-clean-native-20260523`: old placeholder texts and record ids are absent; cart marker remains present; current teen camp loader remains present.
  - Rendered DOM check on `https://moonn.ru/podrostkovyy-lager-psihologiya?qa=dom-clean-native-20260523`: `12-19`, lunch/breaks, parent-presence answer and day-plan text are visible; placeholder texts are absent.

## 2026-05-03 — Paid Video Lectures On `events_tp`

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Workstream: paid video lectures and protected access.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-paid-video-lectures`.
- User request:
  - convert `https://moonn.ru/events_tp` from a registration/event page into a paid lecture storefront;
  - use price `1300 RUB` per lecture;
  - connect Tilda payment and protected video viewing;
  - use QR code and direct page link for promotion;
  - user approved one test scenario.
- Decisions:
  - Treat `events_tp` as the canonical pilot storefront, not `lectures1`.
  - Use Tilda products/cart plus Members/Courses access after payment.
  - Do not expose raw YouTube links on the public sales page.
  - Do not create or change live T-Bank/Tinkoff payment settings until seller/payment details are visually verified.
  - Use manifest-first rollout so product SKUs, Members groups, videos and QR links stay synchronized.

## 2026-05-26 — Moonn Five-Page SEO/AEO Supervisor Run

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Workstream: five-page SEO/AEO sprint daily audit, branch `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Verified facts:
  - `scripts/moonn_five_page_seo_sprint_audit.py --rendered` reports HTTP `200` for all 5 live URLs, `sitemap=true`, `robots blocked=false`, rendered H1 count = `1` on all five.
  - Known regression persists: `https://moonn.ru/podrostkovyy-lager-psihologiya` rendered answer block count = `0` (expected `1` for sprint layer).
- Changed files:
  - `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-05-26.json`
  - `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-05-26.md`
  - `docs/moonn-seo-growth-backlog.md`
  - `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-change-ledger-2026-05-21.json`
- Created or changed files:
  - `scripts/tilda_paid_lecture_audit.py`
  - `scripts/build_events_tp_paid_manifest.py`
  - `registry/products/paid-video-lectures-audit-2026-05-03.json`
  - `registry/products/paid-video-lectures.schema.json`
  - `registry/products/paid-video-lectures.manifest.json`
  - `assets/qr/tatyana-munn-paid-lectures-events-tp-qr.png`
  - `docs/paid-video-lectures-tilda-plan-2026-05-03.md`
- Verified:
  - Read-only Tilda API audit completed.
  - `events_tp` Tilda page id is `66814657`.
  - 10 unique Timepad event IDs were extracted from `events_tp`.
  - JSON files are syntactically valid.
  - QR image was generated for `https://moonn.ru/events_tp`.
- Open questions / blockers:
  - Video URL is still needed for each lecture.
  - User clarified that YouTube recordings are private/hidden, so public channel scan is insufficient.
  - YouTube Studio access or an exported owner video list is needed to match videos to lectures.
  - Confirm whether Timepad event `3334362` is a sellable recording or only a series/archive entry.
  - Tilda payment provider must be checked visually; read-only API did not expose active payment details.
  - Before production, run one staging or safe live test purchase and verify post-payment access.
- Risk notes:
  - Money/payment settings, seller requisites and paid content access are high-risk.
  - YouTube unlisted links are not real copy protection; use protected Tilda access as the minimum safe layer.

## 2026-05-03 — Private YouTube Matching For Paid Lectures

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Workstream: paid video lectures and protected access.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-paid-video-lectures`.
- User request:
  - use owner access to the YouTube channel because recordings are private/hidden;
  - match recordings by title/date to the `events_tp` lecture list;
  - prepare the paid-access rollout without exposing raw private links.
- Decisions:
  - Store private video ids and Studio URLs only in local ignored output, not in Git.
  - Commit only sanitized match status and manifest state.
  - Keep live payment/product creation behind a high-risk gate until Tilda payment provider/seller settings are visually verified.
- Created or changed files:
  - `.gitignore`
  - `registry/products/paid-video-lectures.manifest.json`
  - `registry/products/paid-video-lectures-youtube-match-status-2026-05-03.json`
  - `docs/paid-video-lectures-youtube-matching-status-2026-05-03.md`
  - `docs/paid-video-lectures-tilda-plan-2026-05-03.md`
- Verified:
  - YouTube Studio owner view opened for the correct channel.
  - February-March 2026 lecture recordings were found in Studio.
  - Five lecture mappings are unique enough for a first protected Tilda pilot.
  - Four lecture mappings need owner selection because multiple plausible recordings exist.
- Open questions / blockers:
  - Select the correct duplicate for `2604 Духовная психология`.
  - Select the correct duplicate for `2607 Психология мужчины`.
  - Select the correct `2608 ИИ и ЭИ` recording.
  - Decide whether `Быстрая психология` should sell part 1, part 2, or both as one product.
  - Verify Tilda payment provider and run one approved test purchase.
- Risk notes:
  - Shared credentials and private video links are sensitive; rotate the password after the setup session.
  - Public sales pages must not expose raw private or unlisted YouTube links.

## 2026-05-03 — Live Moonn SEO Metadata Audit

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Workstream: live SEO/AEO audit.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: SEO heartbeat continued safe follow-up work while paid video lectures remain paused.
- User-facing boundary:
  - No Tilda edits were made.
  - No payment/product/private-video changes were made.
- Created files:
  - `docs/moonn-live-seo-metadata-audit-2026-05-03.json`
  - `docs/moonn-live-seo-metadata-audit-2026-05-03.md`
- Verified:
  - 9 priority Moonn URLs return HTTP `200`.
  - All 9 have canonical and `og:image`.
  - Only `https://moonn.ru/psiholog-moskva-online` exposes JSON-LD.
- Findings:
  - 8 of 9 checked pages need page-specific JSON-LD.
  - 5 pages have no detected H1.
  - Main page and depression page have too many detected H1 tags.
  - `events_tp` has a very short generic description.
- Follow-up rule:
  - Next safe SEO step is a per-page Tilda SEO patch packet, not direct live edits: title, description, one-H1 instruction, JSON-LD, canonical confirmation and image/OG note.

## 2026-05-03 — Moonn Tilda SEO Patch Packets

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Workstream: live SEO/AEO audit.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: SEO heartbeat continued from the live metadata audit.
- User-facing boundary:
  - No live Tilda edits were made.
  - No undocumented Tilda endpoints were used.
  - No payment/product/private-video/review-screenshot changes were made.
- Created files:
  - `docs/moonn-tilda-seo-patch-packets-2026-05-03.json`
  - `docs/moonn-tilda-seo-patch-packets-2026-05-03.md`
- Result:
  - Prepared page-specific SEO packets for 9 Moonn priority URLs.
  - Each packet includes proposed title, description, H1, canonical, schema types, image alt pattern and reindex flag.
  - The packets preserve the public entity bridge: `Татьяна Мунн`, `Кумскова Татьяна Михайловна`, МГУ, Moonn, Timepad, MIIIIPS, Yandex Services, MSU Istina and PsyJournals.
- Follow-up rule:
  - Next safe step is generating final JSON-LD code blocks per page, then applying them only through supported Tilda page head/code fields after the safe path is confirmed.

## 2026-05-04 — Moonn Tilda JSON-LD Blocks

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Workstream: live SEO/AEO audit.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: SEO heartbeat continued from the Tilda SEO patch packets.
- User-facing boundary:
  - No live Tilda edits were made.
  - No undocumented Tilda endpoints were used.
  - No review, rating, payment, product or private-video data was added.
- Created files:
  - `docs/moonn-tilda-jsonld-blocks-2026-05-04.json`
  - `docs/moonn-tilda-jsonld-blocks-2026-05-04.md`
- Result:
  - Prepared JSON-LD graph objects for 9 priority Moonn URLs.
  - Connected each page to the same person/entity bridge: Татьяна Мунн / Кумскова Татьяна Михайловна / МГУ / Moonn / Timepad / MIIIIPS / Yandex Services / MSU Istina / PsyJournals.
  - Excluded `Review`, `AggregateRating`, copied reviews, private videos, prices and medical treatment claims by design.
- Follow-up rule:
  - Insert JSON-LD only through supported Tilda page head/code fields, then re-audit live HTML for `application/ld+json` before requesting indexing.

## 2026-05-04 — Yandex Services Review URL Canonicalization

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Workstream: live SEO/AEO audit / reviews page.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: SEO heartbeat final self-check found an old Yandex Services profile slug in the local reviews page data.
- Changed files:
  - `data/site.json`
- Decision:
  - Replace the old review profile URL `TatyanaKumskovamunn-948629` with the canonical redirected profile URL `TatyanaKumskovatatyanamunn-948629`.
  - Do not publish reviews, screenshots, reviewer names, avatars or copied review text.
- Verified:
  - The old Yandex Services profile URL redirects to the canonical URL.
  - `data/site.json` remains valid JSON.
- Follow-up rule:
  - Any future reviews page rollout must use the canonical Yandex Services profile URL and must pass personal-data/platform/legal gates before showing review evidence.

## 2026-05-04 — Final Moonn Sitemap SEO Audit

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Workstream: live SEO/AEO audit.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- User request:
  - run the final SEO audit for Moonn pages.
- Boundary:
  - Read-only live audit.
  - No Tilda edits, no payment/product/private-video changes, no review publication.
- Created files:
  - `scripts/moonn_final_seo_audit.py`
  - `docs/moonn-final-seo-audit-2026-05-04.json`
  - `docs/moonn-final-seo-audit-2026-05-04.md`
  - `docs/moonn-final-seo-audit-2026-05-04.csv`
  - `docs/moonn-final-seo-action-plan-2026-05-04.md`
- Verified:
  - `https://moonn.ru/sitemap.xml` contains 148 URLs.
  - All 148 checked URLs returned HTTP `200`.
  - `robots.txt` is live and references the sitemap.
- Findings:
  - 98 URLs should be strengthened for SEO.
  - 45 opaque/test URLs should be reviewed for noindex, semantic rename or 301.
  - 5 important psychology URLs are blocked by broad `Disallow: /psiholog`.
  - 139 URLs have no detected JSON-LD.
  - 91 URLs have no detected H1.
  - 52 URLs have duplicate descriptions.
  - 8 URLs have canonical mismatch.
- Incident:
  - Symptom: current `robots.txt` blocks useful `/psiholog...` pages.
  - Root cause: broad legacy disallow rule `Disallow: /psiholog` matches current semantic psychology URLs by prefix.
  - Resolution: recorded as P0 fix; update Tilda/robots settings to block only exact legacy URLs, then retest in GSC/Yandex.
  - Follow-up rule: never add broad robots rules for short commercial prefixes when semantic pages may share the same prefix.

## 2026-05-04 — Corrected Production Scope SEO Audit

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Workstream: live SEO/AEO audit.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- User correction:
  - The intended audit scope is not every URL in `sitemap.xml`, but the real published production pages we worked with earlier.
- Decision:
  - Treat `output/production-73-rollout-pages.json` plus `output/build-production-83-scope.log` additions as the canonical working scope.
  - Keep the previous 148-URL sitemap audit only as sitemap-hygiene evidence, not as the main production-page SEO scope.
- Created / updated files:
  - `scripts/moonn_final_seo_audit.py`
  - `docs/moonn-production-scope-seo-audit-2026-05-04.json`
  - `docs/moonn-production-scope-seo-audit-2026-05-04.md`
  - `docs/moonn-production-scope-seo-audit-2026-05-04.csv`
  - `docs/moonn-production-scope-seo-action-plan-2026-05-04.md`
- Verified:
  - Corrected scope contains 83 URLs.
  - All 83 URLs return HTTP `200`.
- Findings:
  - 77 URLs need SEO strengthening.
  - 3 real pages are blocked by broad robots rules and need robots fix before strengthening.
  - 2 URLs, `st1` and `st2`, need semantic rename or noindex/redirect decision.
  - 1 legacy `/psiholog` page should stay out of index or be removed/redirected.
  - 82 of 83 scoped pages have no detected JSON-LD.
  - 44 scoped pages have no detected H1.
- Follow-up rule:
  - Future Moonn SEO progress checks must use the production scope file, not the whole Tilda sitemap, unless the task is explicitly sitemap cleanup.

## 2026-05-04 — Moonn Production SEO Strengthening Packets

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user asked to strengthen SEO for the `77` pages from the corrected production scope, then handle the `3` robots-blocked pages.
- Strategic decision:
  - Treat the work as a machine-first Tilda application packet because the documented Tilda API is read/export oriented and does not provide a supported bulk write endpoint for page SEO fields.
  - Do not use undocumented Tilda endpoints for live production edits.
  - Generate per-page title, description, canonical, H1 action, image alt pattern and JSON-LD instead of applying one generic SEO block to all pages.
- Created or changed files:
  - `scripts/build_moonn_production_seo_strengthening_packets.py`
  - `docs/moonn-production-seo-strengthening-packets-2026-05-04.json`
  - `docs/moonn-production-seo-strengthening-packets-2026-05-04.md`
  - `docs/moonn-production-seo-strengthening-packets-2026-05-04.csv`
  - `docs/moonn-robots-fix-packet-2026-05-04.md`
- Results:
  - `77` pages marked `ready_to_apply`.
  - `3` pages marked `apply_after_robots_fix`.
  - CSV validation: `80` rows.
  - Max title length: `68`.
  - Max description length: `158`.
  - No short descriptions and no unfinished description punctuation.
- Robots finding:
  - Live `robots.txt` has broad `Disallow: /psiholog`, which blocks real working URLs:
    - `https://moonn.ru/psiholog-konsultacii-moskva`
    - `https://moonn.ru/psiholog_moskva`
    - `https://moonn.ru/psihology`
- Open questions / blockers:
  - Live Tilda application still requires supported UI editing or another documented write-capable path.
  - Robots change should be applied in Tilda settings and then verified live before applying the three page packets.
- Follow-up rule:
  - For Moonn/Tilda SEO, generate deterministic per-page packets first; apply live changes only through supported Tilda fields, then re-run `python scripts/moonn_final_seo_audit.py --production-scope`.

## 2026-05-04 — Moonn Production SEO Applied Through Tilda UI

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user asked to start live application in the real Google Chrome profile already logged into Tilda, not Playwright or Codex in-app browser.
- Routing:
  - Used visible Google Chrome window with Tilda account `Alexander`.
  - Browser MCP extension was visually enabled but tool transport still returned `Transport closed`; did not switch to Playwright for Tilda.
  - Used supported Tilda page settings UI (`EditPageSettings`) and native save/publish controls; did not use undocumented Tilda write endpoints.
- Created files:
  - `scripts/tilda_page_seo_settings_ui_rollout.py`
  - `docs/moonn-ready-77-live-seo-verification-2026-05-04.json`
  - `docs/moonn-production-80-live-seo-verification-2026-05-04.json`
  - `docs/moonn-production-80-live-seo-rollout-2026-05-04.md`
- Live changes:
  - Applied page-specific `meta_title`, `meta_descr`, `link_canonical`, `nosearch=false`, `meta_nofollow=false` for `77` ready production pages.
  - Published every changed page.
  - Fixed legacy `/psiholog` page robots prefix issue by removing noindex/nofollow and setting canonical to `https://moonn.ru/psiholog-konsultacii-moskva`.
  - Applied the same SEO settings to the `3` formerly robots-blocked production pages.
- Verified:
  - `77/77` ready pages returned HTTP `200` and matched title/description/canonical packets.
  - `robots.txt` no longer contains broad `Disallow: /psiholog`.
  - Final `80/80` production pages returned HTTP `200`.
  - Final `80/80` title, description and canonical matched packets.
  - Final `80/80` are clear of robots blocks.
- Incident:
  - Symptom: first bulk attempt produced false errors after the first page because the next iteration started from the Tilda page editor after publish.
  - Root cause: UI automation did not reset to the canonical project page before each page settings operation.
  - Resolution: updated rollout script to call `ensure_project_page()` before every page settings edit.
  - Follow-up rule: Tilda UI batch automation must reset to a known canonical screen per item before opening settings, saving or publishing.
- Residual work:
  - Source-level H1/H2 cleanup inside Tilda blocks.
  - Source-level image replacement/filename migration in Tilda storage.
  - Review/noindex/rename decision for `st1` and `st2`.
  - Compliant Yandex Services reviews page.
  - Manual profile text synchronization for Yandex Services and MGU Istina.

## 2026-05-06 — Moonn H1/H2 Source Cleanup Pilot

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user asked to finish morning checklist points 2 and 3: final SEO audit and H1/H2 cleanup plan/application on original published pages.
- Created files:
  - `docs/moonn-production-scope-seo-audit-2026-05-06.json`

  - `scripts/build_moonn_h1_h2_capability_buckets.py`
  - `scripts/tilda_h1_h2_gui_apply.py`
- Live change:
  - Applied `SEO: тег для заголовка -> H1` to `https://moonn.ru/aromatherapy`, page `62470081`, record `860030752`, block type `485`.
- Verified:
  - Live production audit after the pilot: `83/83` URLs returned HTTP `200`.
  - `missing_h1` decreased from `44` to `43`.
  - `multiple_h1` remains `14`.
  - Capability buckets: `1` supported block-setting action, `24` unsupported actions needing design solution, `27` manual-verify actions.
- Incident:
  - Symptom: automation initially tried to operate on the wrong Chrome tab / Codex window and later failed on several blocks.
  - Root cause: GUI automation was not pinned to the authenticated Tilda tab strongly enough, and the initial plan assumed all Tilda blocks expose the same heading-tag UI field.
  - Resolution: switched navigation to the real Chrome address-bar control and verified block capability visually. Found that block type `485` supports the SEO heading tag field, while tested block types `18` and `578` do not expose it.
  - Follow-up rule: H1/H2 cleanup must be bucketed by proven Tilda block capability. Do not batch-apply SEO heading tags to block types until one record of that type has been verified in Tilda UI.
- Residual work:
  - Rebuild H1/H2 plan into `supported_block_setting`, `unsupported_needs_design_solution`, and `manual_verify`.
  - For unsupported missing-H1 pages, choose a supported design-level solution: add a semantic H1 block or replace the hero/title block type.
  - For multiple-H1 pages, test each secondary heading block type before live batch changes.

## 2026-05-07 — Moonn Scoped H1/H2 Publish Follow-Up

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user asked to continue from the stopped point and avoid publishing all Tilda pages; target scope is the original published Moonn work set, not all `164` project pages.
- Created/updated files:
  - `scripts/tilda_publish_moonn_seo_scope_ui.py`
  - `docs/moonn-seo-scope-publish-report-2026-05-07.json`
  - `docs/moonn-extra-live-pages-publish-report-2026-05-07.json`
- Actions:
  - Verified that live `moonn.ru` still served semantic heading layer `@9483a34`, not final `@1e53aae`.
  - Verified that live global HEAD still had broken Yandex.Metrika JavaScript (`m[i]=m[i]function...`) after earlier UI attempts.
  - Saved corrected global HEAD in the Tilda global HEAD editor and confirmed the editor value after reload contained `@1e53aae` and valid `m[i]=m[i]||function`.
  - Published only the scoped `80` SEO packet pages through Tilda UI.
  - Published `3` extra live pages through Tilda UI: `/psiholog`, `/st1`, `/st2`.
- Verification:
  - Tilda UI publish reports marked `80/80` scoped pages and `3/3` extra live pages as published.
  - Live/API HTML verification still returned old global HEAD `@9483a34` and broken Metrika. The global HEAD change did not propagate to public HTML through scoped page publishing.
  - A one-page page-level HEAD pilot on `/` also did not persist into Tilda API/published HTML when changed through UIA field value alone.
- Incident:
  - Symptom: Tilda editor UI can display corrected HEAD after reload, while public HTML and Tilda API still return the old published HEAD.
  - Root cause: UIA `set_edit_text`/accessibility-field edits can update the visible Ace editor value without reliably updating Tilda's underlying Ace/editor model submitted to the server.
  - Resolution so far: stopped before claiming completion or using publish-all. Scoped publish report was recorded; live result remains old.
  - Follow-up rule: for Tilda Ace editors, do not treat UIA field value as proof. The readiness gate is: persisted server value or published HTML/API contains the expected marker. If only publish-all can propagate global HEAD, get explicit approval because it may touch non-target project pages.
- Residual work:
  - Continue H1/H2 completion only after choosing a safe Tilda-supported write path: real Ace keyboard editing verified by API, supported Tilda UI field per page/block, or explicit approval for project-level publish-all if it is confirmed to publish only already-public pages.
  - Re-run `python scripts\moonn_rendered_heading_audit.py` only after live HTML contains `@1e53aae`.

## 2026-05-07 — Moonn Tilda Folder Governance Inventory

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user approved the stronger Tilda folder governance path before global HEAD publish: move test/draft pages into archive folders, then use Tilda's supported folder-aware publish flow.
- Verified external rule:
  - Tilda Help says pages can be moved to folders through drag-and-drop or Page Settings → Additional.
  - Tilda Help says folders can be marked as archive, and archived folders are excluded from publish-all/folder publish flows.
- Created files:
  - `docs/moonn-tilda-page-governance-inventory-2026-05-07.json`
  - `docs/moonn-tilda-page-governance-inventory-2026-05-07.md`
- Read-only inventory:
  - Official Tilda API `getpageslist` returned `164` project pages.
  - `83` pages are protected work scope and must remain publishable.
  - `8` pages are clear archive candidates by title/alias: tests, copies, old teen-camp pages.
  - `73` pages are published outside the current SEO scope and require human/content classification before moving; they include legal pages, payment success pages, news, old SEO landing pages, code/media holder pages and no-alias article pages.
- UI finding:
  - The real Alexander Chrome/Tilda session opened the Moonn project and existing folder `ТЕСТЫ для АЛЕКС МАРК` (`folderid=2421516`).
  - The project currently shows a Tilda subscription-expired banner: "Пожалуйста, оплатите подписку / Время истекло".
  - Folder settings button did not open a settings dialog during this check, likely because project management is restricted while the subscription is expired.
- Decision:
  - Do not move `73` published outside-scope pages automatically. Several are legitimate public/legal/payment pages.
  - Do not run project publish-all until archive-folder settings are confirmed and the excluded folder set is verified.
- Follow-up rule:
  - For Tilda global HEAD rollout, the required safety gate is: protected work-scope list, archive-candidate list, folder archive state verified in UI, then controlled publish. If subscription is expired or folder settings cannot be opened, stop and record blocker instead of forcing a broad publish.

## 2026-05-08 — Moonn Post-Payment Tilda HEAD Rollout Verification

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user paid Tilda Business and asked whether the unpaid subscription caused previous changes not to appear.
- Context:
  - Tilda Business is paid through `2026-06-08`; project controls are available again.
  - The real Alexander Google Chrome/Tilda session was used. OBS was minimized after it interfered with visible desktop coordinates.
- Actions:
  - Rechecked live HTML after payment: protected URLs still served old global HEAD `@9483a34` and broken Yandex.Metrika before publication.
  - Verified the Tilda global HEAD editor persisted the corrected code after navigating away and back:
    - semantic heading layer `@1e53aae`;
    - valid Yandex.Metrika snippet with `m[i]=m[i]||function`.
  - Published a one-page pilot (`/`) through supported Tilda UI and confirmed live HTML switched to `@1e53aae`.
  - Published the remaining scoped `80/80` SEO packet pages through `scripts/tilda_publish_moonn_seo_scope_ui.py`.
  - Published `3/3` extra live pages through Tilda UI: `/psiholog`, `/st1`, `/st2`.
- Changed files:
  - `docs/moonn-seo-scope-publish-report-2026-05-07.json`
  - `docs/moonn-extra-live-pages-publish-report-2026-05-07.json`
  - `docs/moonn-rendered-heading-audit-2026-05-06.json`
  - `docs/moonn-rendered-heading-audit-2026-05-06.md`
  - `docs/moonn-rendered-heading-audit-2026-05-06.csv`
  - `docs/moonn-production-scope-seo-audit-2026-05-07.json`
  - `docs/moonn-production-scope-seo-audit-2026-05-07.md`
  - `docs/moonn-production-scope-seo-audit-2026-05-07.csv`
- Verification:
  - Live HTML spot checks for `/`, `/emotional-intelligence/knowledge-base/empathy`, `/events_tp`, `/psiholog-konsultacii-moskva`, `/psiholog`, `/st1`, `/st2` all returned:
    - `@1e53aae`: true;
    - `@9483a34`: false;
    - `m[i]=m[i]||function`: true.
  - `python scripts\moonn_rendered_heading_audit.py`:
    - `83/83` pages loaded;
    - `83/83` pages have semantic layer script;
    - `83/83` pages have exactly one rendered H1;
    - `0` missing H1;
    - `0` multiple H1;
    - `52/52` target H1/H2 checks matched;
    - `0` errors.
  - `python scripts\moonn_final_seo_audit.py --production-scope`:
    - `83/83` URLs returned HTTP `200`;
    - raw HTML audit still flags `missing_h1`/`multiple_h1` because this audit does not execute the semantic heading JS layer.
- Decision:
  - Payment was a blocker for management access, but it was not the only reason changes did not appear. The actual live rollout required supported Tilda save plus scoped page publication.
  - H1/H2 readiness should now be judged by rendered audit, not raw HTML audit alone, because the implemented solution is a global semantic JS layer.
- Incident rule:
  - When Tilda global HEAD changes are used, the readiness gate is three-stage: persisted editor value after navigation, scoped published live HTML marker, rendered browser audit.
  - Do not treat raw HTML H1/H2 findings as final when the chosen implementation is a rendered semantic layer; pair raw audits with rendered audits and explicitly label the difference.
- Residual work:
  - Folder/archive governance remains open: only `8` clear archive candidates can be considered for archive movement; `73` outside-scope published pages need content classification before moving.
  - SEO image alt/title and JSON-LD work remain separate follow-ups; current turn closed the HEAD/H1-H2 rollout.

## 2026-05-08 — Moonn JSON-LD Schema Rollout And Archive Packet

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Commit: `0148735` (`Roll out Moonn JSON-LD schema layer`).
- Trigger: user asked to finish JSON-LD/schema and careful Tilda folder/archive cleanup before moving to GSC/Yandex reindexing, Yandex Services reviews and Yandex Services/MSU Istina synchronization.
- Actions:
  - Created a global rendered JSON-LD schema layer for the `83` Moonn production-scope URLs.
  - Added a global entity schema in Tilda HEAD for `Person`/`WebSite` linking Tatyana Moonn, Kumskova identity, Moonn and external entity signals.
  - Saved the updated Tilda global HEAD through the real authenticated Alexander Google Chrome session.
  - Published only the scoped `80/80` SEO packet pages, then the `3/3` extra live pages: `/psiholog`, `/st1`, `/st2`.
  - Created a rendered schema audit so JSON-LD readiness is checked in the same rendered layer as the semantic H1/H2 fix.
  - Created a Tilda archive execution packet for exactly `8` clear archive candidates.
- Changed files:
  - `assets/moonn-schema-layer.js`
  - `scripts/build_moonn_schema_layer.py`
  - `scripts/moonn_rendered_schema_audit.py`
  - `scripts/tilda_publish_moonn_extra_live_pages_ui.py`
  - `scripts/build_moonn_tilda_archive_execution_packet.py`
  - `docs/moonn-global-head-code-with-schema-2026-05-08.html`

  - `docs/moonn-tilda-archive-execution-packet-2026-05-08.md`
  - `docs/moonn-tilda-archive-execution-packet-2026-05-08.csv`
- Verification:
  - `node --check assets\moonn-schema-layer.js` passed.
  - Live HTML spot checks for `/`, `/emotional-intelligence/knowledge-base/empathy`, `/events_tp`, `/psiholog-konsultacii-moskva`, `/psiholog`, `/st1`, `/st2` all returned:
    - `moonn-global-entity-schema`: true;
    - `moonn-schema-layer`: true;
    - schema commit marker `0e5967eaa5d2fcca54900772ff632f91f090f073`: true;
    - `application/ld+json`: true.
  - `python scripts\moonn_rendered_schema_audit.py`:
    - `83/83` URLs HTTP `200`;
    - `83/83` have schema layer script;
    - `83/83` have global entity schema;
    - `83/83` have JSON-LD;
    - `83/83` have `Person`, `WebSite`, `WebPage`, `BreadcrumbList`;
    - `0` JSON errors;
    - `0` page errors.
  - `python scripts\moonn_rendered_heading_audit.py` remains green:
    - `83/83` loaded;
    - `83/83` have exactly one rendered H1;
    - `52/52` target H1/H2 checks matched.
- Folder/archive decision:
  - Official Tilda folder documentation says an Archive Folder is excluded from “Publish all pages”; source recorded in the execution packet: `https://help.tilda.cc/folders`.
  - Live movement was not executed in this step because the safe gate still requires confirming the destination folder in Tilda UI as an Archive Folder.
  - Only the `8` clear candidates in `docs/moonn-tilda-archive-execution-packet-2026-05-08.json` are ready for possible movement. Legal, payment, reviews, news/event, media-holder and ambiguous pages remain protected from automatic movement.
- Incident rule:
  - For Tilda SEO retrofits, distinguish three audit layers: raw HTML, rendered DOM, and search-console indexing state. A raw audit can correctly flag source HTML limitations while rendered audits verify JS-layer remediation.
- Residual work:
  - Execute archive-folder movement only after UI confirmation that the destination folder is an Archive Folder.
  - Image `alt` issues remain in the raw audit and should be handled through supported Tilda image/block fields or a separate image replacement workflow.
  - GSC/Yandex reindexing can start for the 83 production URLs after this schema rollout verification.

## 2026-05-08 — Moonn GSC/Yandex Reindex Submission

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user asked to do GSC/Yandex reindexing for the 83 Moonn production URLs after JSON-LD/schema rollout.
- Actions:
  - Built a reindexing packet for all `83` production-scope URLs:
    - `docs/moonn-gsc-yandex-reindex-packet-2026-05-08.json`
    - `docs/moonn-yandex-reindex-urls-2026-05-08.txt`
    - `docs/moonn-google-priority-indexing-urls-2026-05-08.txt`
  - Verified live `https://moonn.ru/sitemap.xml` has `149` URL entries and includes all `83/83` production-scope URLs.
  - Submitted `sitemap.xml` in Google Search Console for property `https://moonn.ru/`.
  - Submitted all `83` URLs in Yandex Webmaster via `Индексирование -> Переобход страниц`.
- Verification:
  - Google Search Console UI showed `Sitemap submitted successfully`.
  - Yandex Webmaster showed daily limit `470` before submission and `387` remaining after submission, matching `83` submitted URLs.
  - Yandex UI cleared the textarea and showed the submitted-pages section after send.
- Changed files:
  - `docs/moonn-gsc-yandex-reindex-packet-2026-05-08.json`
  - `docs/moonn-yandex-reindex-urls-2026-05-08.txt`
  - `docs/moonn-google-priority-indexing-urls-2026-05-08.txt`
  - `docs/moonn-gsc-yandex-reindex-report-2026-05-08.json`
  - `docs/moonn-gsc-yandex-reindex-report-2026-05-08.md`
- Decision:
  - Google bulk reindexing was handled through sitemap submission, not 83 individual URL Inspection requests, because Google documentation recommends sitemap for multiple URLs and quota-limits individual indexing requests.
  - Yandex supports bulk URL submission in the Reindex Pages tool and accepted the full 83-URL packet within the visible daily quota.
- Sources:
  - Google recrawl documentation: `https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/ask-google-to-recrawl`
  - Google Search Console help: `https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/10351509`
  - Yandex reindex documentation: `https://yandex.ru/support/webmaster/ru/robot-workings/site-reindex`
  - Yandex Webmaster quotas: `https://yandex.ru/support/webmaster/ru/indexing-options/quotas`
- Follow-up rule:
  - Do not keep resubmitting the same URLs every day. First check Yandex statuses after several days and repeat only failed URLs. In Google, check sitemap last-read and Pages indexing; use URL Inspection only for priority URLs if key pages stay stale.

## 2026-05-08 — Moonn Manual Google URL Inspection Priority Requests

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user asked to try Google manually after sitemap submission and add Google status checks to the follow-up automation.
- Actions:
  - Used the real Google Chrome profile with the already-authenticated Alexander Rublev Google account.
  - Opened Google Search Console URL Inspection for property `https://moonn.ru/`.
  - Manually requested indexing for priority URLs:
    - `https://moonn.ru/`
    - `https://moonn.ru/events_tp`
    - `https://moonn.ru/lectures1`
    - `https://moonn.ru/psiholog-konsultacii-moskva`
  - Updated:
    - `docs/moonn-gsc-yandex-reindex-report-2026-05-08.json`
    - `docs/moonn-gsc-yandex-reindex-report-2026-05-08.md`
- Verification:
  - GSC showed `Indexing requested` for all four priority URLs.
  - For `/events_tp`, GSC showed the important pre-request status: `Page is not indexed: Discovered - currently not indexed`.
  - For `/`, `/lectures1`, and `/psiholog-konsultacii-moskva`, GSC showed the pages as already indexed before the manual request.
- Decision:
  - Do not manually submit all `83` URLs through URL Inspection because it is quota-limited and Google recommends sitemap submission for bulk recrawling.
  - The next check must include Google sitemap last-read, Pages indexing, and URL Inspection statuses for the four manually requested priority URLs.

## 2026-05-08 — Moonn RKN/Privacy Compliance Intake

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user raised Roskomnadzor personal-data/cookie/form-policy scanner risk and asked whether bot access can be limited.
- Actions:
  - Checked live standard policy endpoints:
    - `/privacy`: `404`
    - `/policy`: `404`
    - `/personal-data`: `404`
    - `/soglasie`: `404`
  - Checked `https://moonn.ru/robots.txt`: `200`.
  - Checked main page signals: Yandex Metrika `96397286` active with clickmap/trackLinks/Webvisor; no Google Analytics signal found in the sampled main HTML.
  - Created audit artifact:
    - `docs/moonn-rkn-privacy-compliance-audit-2026-05-08.md`
- Decision:
  - Treat privacy/RKN compliance as a separate legal/privacy workstream, not as an SEO subtask.
  - Do not try to hide non-compliance from RKN bots. First publish correct documents and form consents, then add conservative bot-control for non-essential AI/scraper bots.
- Blockers:
  - Need confirmed legal operator details and whether an RKN operator notification already exists.
  - Need legal approval before publishing final policy/consent wording.

## 2026-05-08 — Moonn Privacy Compliance Packet and Audit Script

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user asked to execute the first compliance steps: documents, form consents, cookies/analytics notice, and automation; RKN operator notification excluded for now.
- Actions:
  - Created publication packet:
    - `docs/moonn-privacy-publication-packet-2026-05-08.md`
  - Created technical audit script:
    - `scripts/moonn_privacy_compliance_audit.py`
  - Ran the audit against the `83` production-scope URLs.
  - Created reports:
    - `docs/moonn-privacy-compliance-audit-2026-05-08.json`
    - `docs/moonn-privacy-compliance-audit-2026-05-08.md`
    - `docs/moonn-rkn-compliance-rollout-plan-2026-05-08.md`
- Verification:
  - `python scripts\moonn_privacy_compliance_audit.py` completed.
  - `python -m json.tool docs\moonn-privacy-compliance-audit-2026-05-08.json` passed.
  - Audit result: `83/83` production URLs have form signals, `79` pages lack detected checkbox, `58` pages lack detected consent text, and required policy endpoints currently return `404`.
- Decision:
  - Do not publish final legal pages until operator variables are confirmed.
  - Do not add GA4/Google Analytics while the cross-border/legal posture is unresolved; current checked main HTML did not show GA signals.
  - Use Yandex Metrika as the primary analytics layer for now and disclose it clearly in `/cookies` and `/privacy`.
- Automation:
  - Updated `moonn-seo-leftovers-morning-check` into `Moonn SEO and privacy compliance supervisor`.
  - Added weekly privacy/RKN scan duties: rerun `scripts\moonn_privacy_compliance_audit.py`, check legal endpoints, form checkbox/consent text, cookie/Yandex Metrika disclosure, GA/gtag drift, and robots.txt SEO safety.
  - Gate preserved: no live Tilda legal text, RKN notification, personal data publication, payment changes or bot-blocking rules without explicit approval.

## 2026-05-08 — Moonn Privacy Operator Details Filled

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user provided public email `moonn.official@yandex.ru` and asked to prepare privacy pages for Moonn.
- Actions:
  - Checked public sources for ИП Кумскова Татьяна Михайловна.
  - Filled publication packet with:
    - operator: `Индивидуальный предприниматель Кумскова Татьяна Михайловна`;
    - INN: `770906685276`;
    - OGRNIP: `316774600553212`;
    - email: `moonn.official@yandex.ru`.
  - Updated:
    - `docs/moonn-privacy-publication-packet-2026-05-08.md`
    - `docs/moonn-rkn-compliance-rollout-plan-2026-05-08.md`
- Provenance:
  - User-confirmed: public email.
  - Public search result confirmed ИП реквизиты via business profile snippets; full address not copied.
- Remaining gate:
  - Do not publish until the public correspondence/legal address is explicitly confirmed by user or legal source.

## 2026-05-08 — Incident: Wrong External Domain Added To Privacy Packet

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Symptom: `https://umun.ru/` was added to the privacy packet as a related site.
- Root cause: assistant treated a user correction mentioning a domain as ownership confirmation without a domain ownership verification gate.
- Fix:
  - Removed `umun.ru` from:
    - `docs/moonn-privacy-publication-packet-2026-05-08.md`
    - `docs/moonn-rkn-compliance-rollout-plan-2026-05-08.md`
    - the operative history entry above.
- Follow-up rule:
  - Never add an external domain to legal/privacy documents unless ownership/control is verified through Tilda/project settings, DNS/registrar, official site text, or an explicit unambiguous user confirmation after showing the exact domain.

## 2026-05-08 — Moonn RKN/Privacy Layer Published And Verified

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user asked whether the RKN/privacy site changes were actually done and, if not, to finish policy, consent and related page changes.
- Actions:
  - Published the privacy compliance frontend layer through the Moonn Tilda global head.
  - Re-published the protected production scope pages: `80/80` pages in `docs/moonn-seo-scope-publish-report-2026-05-07.json`.
  - Published the existing `/politic` page as the canonical privacy/personal-data policy page.
  - Re-ran the raw privacy audit:
    - `docs/moonn-privacy-compliance-audit-2026-05-08.json`
    - `docs/moonn-privacy-compliance-audit-2026-05-08.md`
  - Created rendered/live verification:
    - `docs/moonn-rkn-live-verification-2026-05-08.md`
- Live verification:
  - `https://moonn.ru/`, `https://moonn.ru/politic`, `https://moonn.ru/psiholog-konsultacii-moskva`, and `https://moonn.ru/events_tp` returned `200` and included `moonn-privacy-compliance-layer`.
  - The rendered homepage had `2` forms and `2` required unchecked `moonn_personal_data_consent` checkboxes linking to `https://moonn.ru/politic`.
  - Rendered `/politic` included ИП Кумскова Татьяна Михайловна, ИНН `770906685276`, ОГРНИП `316774600553212`, `moonn.official@yandex.ru`, cookies, Yandex Metrika and Webvisor disclosure.
  - No checked live page contained `umun.ru`.
- Incident / limitation:
  - The current raw scanner does not execute JavaScript, so it still reports missing checkboxes on many pages even though rendered browser verification confirms the injected layer.
  - Tilda global HEAD editing can duplicate old code if hidden textarea and ACE editor state are mixed.
- Follow-up rule:
  - For RKN/compliance readiness, rendered JS mitigation is not the final source-level state. Next hardening must move the policy text and form checkboxes into native Tilda blocks/settings where possible, and then verify both raw HTML and rendered browser output.

## 2026-05-08 — Moonn Native Policy Source Hardening

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: continue the RKN/privacy hardening after the rendered compliance layer was published.
- Actions:
  - Converted `/politic` page `58199199` from rendered JS replacement dependency to native Tilda text content.
  - Added canonical native text artifact:
    - `docs/moonn-native-politic-text-2026-05-08.txt`
  - Created native form candidate inventory:
    - `docs/moonn-native-form-inventory-2026-05-08.json`
  - Created native form hardening plan:
    - `docs/moonn-native-form-hardening-plan-2026-05-08.md`
  - Updated:
    - `docs/moonn-rkn-live-verification-2026-05-08.md`
- Verification:
  - Tilda API `getpagefull` for `/politic` found native `Политика обработки персональных данных`.
  - Tilda API no longer found old native title `ПОЛИТИКА КОНФИДЕНЦИАЛЬНОСТИ`.
  - Tilda API and live raw HTML found INN `770906685276`, OGRNIP `316774600553212`, `moonn.official@yandex.ru`, and Yandex.Metrika/Webvisor disclosure.
  - Live raw `https://moonn.ru/politic?native-check=20260508` returned `200`.
- Form inventory:
  - `15` production pages have form-like blocks.
  - `21` candidate blocks were detected.
  - `1` block already has a native checkbox signal.
  - Homepage real contact form `42678538` / `rec691008996` is the first native checkbox pilot target.
- Incident / limitation:
  - Direct rich-text paste into Tilda selected only one word in the editor, so source edits must be verified through Tilda API and live raw HTML before being reported as done.
  - The homepage form currently has old consent text but no native required checkbox signal in raw source; rendered JS mitigation remains active, but native checkbox work is still open.
- Follow-up rule:
  - Do not mass-edit all Tilda form blocks until one real form pilot proves the supported Tilda field path and passes API/live/browser verification.

## 2026-05-08 — Moonn Teen Psychology Camp Page Publication

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: publish the teen psychology camp page from local HTML to `moonn.ru`, integrate it into the Moonn site, and preserve SEO/RKN checks.
- Actions:
  - Cleaned the local camp page from external/local residue and base64 image payloads.
  - SEO-renamed and published assets through the GitHub/jsDelivr asset path.
  - Created Tilda page `140348786` with alias `podrostkovyy-lager-psihologiya`.
  - Added page-specific SEO metadata, canonical, OG metadata, JSON-LD and `/politic` link through Tilda HEAD.
  - Published the page to `https://moonn.ru/podrostkovyy-lager-psihologiya`.
  - Prepared homepage banner artifacts and an external banner JS asset.
- Verification:
  - Live camp page returned `200`.
  - Live camp page includes the camp H1/hero text, JSON-LD, canonical URL and `/politic` link.
  - Live camp page does not include Kaspersky residue, base64 payloads or `data:image`.
- Incident / limitation:
  - Tilda accepted page-specific HEAD injection on the new camp page, but the homepage HEAD editor rolled back/rejected additional banner snippets and kept only the previous `moonn-radiant-sanctuary` code.
  - Therefore homepage integration is not complete and must be done as a native Tilda block/card rather than another forced HEAD injection.
- Follow-up rule:
  - For public homepage integrations, do not report completion until the live homepage HTML or rendered browser output contains the new internal link and the visual banner/card is verified.
  - Prefer native Tilda blocks for homepage marketing placements; use HEAD/JS only for low-risk page-local enhancements where Tilda demonstrably preserves the code.

## 2026-05-08 — Moonn Teen Camp Homepage Banner Completed

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user interrupted the previous run and asked to continue: add the teen camp banner to the Moonn homepage, publish it, and verify the camp page buttons, PDF, Telegram and SEO.
- Actions:
  - Added a visible homepage banner through a native Tilda `T123` HTML block on homepage page `42678538`.
  - Published only the homepage from the Tilda page editor, not the whole project.
  - Verified the live homepage HTML includes `moonn-teen-camp-home-banner`, `/podrostkovyy-lager-psihologiya`, camp text and SEO image.
  - Verified in Chrome that the banner is visible and the `Узнать программу` button opens the camp page.
  - Verified the live camp page has title, canonical, JSON-LD, PDF link and Telegram link.
  - Click-tested Telegram: it opens `t.me/moonn_official` and shows the Telegram Desktop handoff prompt.
  - Opened the PDF in Chrome and clicked the PDF viewer download button; the downloaded file content starts with `%PDF-`.
- Live URLs:
  - `https://moonn.ru/`
  - `https://moonn.ru/podrostkovyy-lager-psihologiya`
- Incident / limitation:
  - The camp page button `Узнать про стоимость и рассрочку` currently links to WhatsApp, not to a price section anchor. This is a working contact path, but if the intended UX is scroll-to-price, it needs a small separate edit.
  - The PDF link exists in the page HTML and opens correctly, but it is lower in the materials section; direct PDF verification was used after confirming the link exists in source.
- Follow-up rule:
  - For future Moonn landing pages, homepage integration must be a native visible block first, with live HTML + rendered browser + primary CTA checks before reporting completion.

## 2026-05-09 — Moonn Teen Camp Payment CTA Completed

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: add a real payment entry point to the teen psychology camp landing page and verify that the user can pay 30 000 ₽ through the existing Tilda/T-Bank flow.
- Actions:
  - Updated teen camp page artifacts with the product price, `Оплатить участие` CTA and native Tilda order link.
  - Preserved the native Tilda cart record `rec2251553291` / block `706` instead of replacing it with a custom payment layer.
  - Added runtime repair so the custom-rendered landing page restores `.t706` cart DOM that the older loader had displaced.
  - Bound the payment CTA to native Tilda cart functions: `tcart__addProduct`, `tcart__reDrawCartIcon`, `tcart__openCart`.
  - Purged the encoded jsDelivr branch URL so Tilda loaded the current external page artifact.
  - Added payment rollout report:
    - `docs/teen-psychology-camp-2026/payment-rollout-report-2026-05-09.md`
  - Added verification screenshot:
    - `docs/teen-psychology-camp-2026/cart-headless-check.png`
- Verification:
  - Live page keeps the native Tilda cart script and `.t706` cart record.
  - PDF link returns `200`, `application/pdf`, size `245793`.
  - Headless browser click on `Оплатить участие` opens the cart modal with product `Подростковый лагерь по психологии`, SKU `teen-camp-2026`, price `30 000р.`, T-Bank card payment and T-Bank installment option.
  - Real Google Chrome check also showed the visible cart modal with order, price and T-Bank payment options.
  - No card details were entered and no real payment was submitted.
- Incident / root cause:
  - The first custom Tilda loader replaced body content and broke/displaced the native cart DOM.
  - Tilda timed out on a large HEAD payload, so the stable approach is compact loader plus external artifact.
  - Native `#order` parsing did not bind reliably after custom rendering, so the CTA now calls native Tilda cart functions directly.
- Follow-up rule:
  - For future paid Moonn/Tilda pages, reuse native Tilda cart/payment blocks where they exist, verify the real provider-backed cart in browser, and keep real payment submission as a separate explicitly approved test.

## 2026-05-09 — Moonn Chat Recovery Index

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user reopened Codex after reinstall and asked to recover which prior Moonn-related chats/workstreams existed, so future work continues in the right project instead of recreating unrelated chats.
- Actions:
  - Confirmed the active Moonn repository is `C:\пайто н тесты\Ано_институт_глаболизация\moon-psy-site`, not `C:\пайто н тесты\курсэмоциональный интеллект`.
  - Checked global Codex `session_index.jsonl` for Moonn/Tatiana Munn/Tilda/Timepad/payment-related thread records.
  - Checked local raw sessions under `C:\Users\yanta\.codex\sessions`.
  - Created recovery index:
    - `docs/moonn-chat-recovery-index-2026-05-09.md`
- Verification:
  - Found older thread ids/names for March-April and May 1, but their raw session files are missing locally after reinstall.
  - Found May 9 recovery raw sessions locally.
  - Confirmed `docs/codex-chat-history.md` remains the canonical project-level memory for Moonn workstreams.
- Follow-up rule:
  - Before restarting any Moonn workstream, first read `docs/moonn-chat-recovery-index-2026-05-09.md` and `docs/codex-chat-history.md`; only open raw sessions when the exact thread id is present locally or restored from backup.

## 2026-05-09 — Moonn Chat Restore Prompts

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user asked for one startup prompt per recovered chat title, so newly created Codex chats can be renamed to old chat names and reconnected to the correct repository/workstream.
- Actions:
  - Created restore prompt packet:
    - `docs/moonn-chat-restore-prompts-2026-05-09.md`
  - Included prompts for research, public links, Yandex/Timepad/site promotion, school/event promotion, Tilda API, Moonn recovery, chat repository discovery and current Yandex/Timepad/agent continuation.
- Verification:
  - Each prompt points to the canonical repository `C:\пайто н тесты\Ано_институт_глаболизация\moon-psy-site`.
  - Each prompt instructs the restored chat to read `docs/moonn-chat-recovery-index-2026-05-09.md` and `docs/codex-chat-history.md` first.
  - High-risk gates for payment, legal/privacy, personal data, Tilda publish-all and live external changes are preserved.
- Follow-up rule:
  - When creating a replacement chat for a missing raw Moonn thread, use the exact old chat title plus the matching prompt from `docs/moonn-chat-restore-prompts-2026-05-09.md`; do not start from a blank generic prompt.

## 2026-05-09 — Moonn Teen Camp Tilda/T-Bank Payment Completed

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user asked to finish real payment for `Подростковый лагерь по психологии` on `moonn.ru` through the correct Tilda route, not through a detached custom HTML payment workaround.
- Actions:
  - Kept native Tilda ST100/T-Bank as the payment layer.
  - Updated the external page artifact so `Оплатить участие` opens native Tilda cart through `tcart__addProduct`, `tcart__reDrawCartIcon` and `tcart__openCart`.
  - Updated the Tilda page HEAD loader to the committed bridge artifact.
  - Corrected the Tilda HEAD save path by writing through the Ace editor model, then reopened and verified persistence.
  - Published Tilda page `140348786` in project `8326812`.
- Verification:
  - Live HTML check: `@b7fc89f` is present, old `@6e83435` is absent, `20260509-native-cart-bridge` is present.
  - Chrome Alexander profile check: clicking `Оплатить участие` opens the Tilda cart with one product, SKU `teen-camp-2026`, amount `30 000 р.`.
  - Checkout form check: test name/email/phone and consent reveal `Перейти к оплате через T-Bank`.
  - Provider check: the flow redirects to `pay.tbank.ru` and shows T-Bank card-entry fields with `30 000 ₽`.
  - No card details were submitted and no real payment was made.
- Commits:
  - `b7fc89f` — `Open teen camp checkout via native Tilda cart`
  - `6ca1991` — `Point teen camp Tilda head loader to native cart bridge`
- Incident / root cause:
  - Native `#order`/hash binding was not reliable after custom HEAD rendering, and the first Tilda HEAD save attempts changed textarea/accessibility state without persisting the Ace editor value.
- Follow-up rule:
  - For paid Moonn/Tilda pages, verify the full chain before reporting readiness: Tilda HEAD reopen -> Tilda publish -> live HTML -> one-product cart -> provider card-entry page. Real payment submission remains a separate high-risk action requiring explicit approval.

## 2026-05-09 — Payment Fix Learning Note

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user asked why the payment problem took too long and requested that the error path and solution be recorded for future self-learning.
- What failed in the previous approach:
  - I trusted Tilda's visible save state too early instead of verifying the Ace editor value after reopening the HEAD settings.
  - I assumed a custom CTA/order hash would behave like a native Tilda product block, even though the page body is custom-mounted from an external artifact.
  - I treated "a cart opens" as sufficient progress, while the actual acceptance criterion was stricter: exactly one product, `30 000 р.`, and provider-backed T-Bank card entry.
- Key turning point:
  - The problem was reframed from "make payment work in custom HTML" to "keep native Tilda/T-Bank as the source of truth and build only a minimal bridge from the custom page to native cart functions."
  - The deeper behavioral turning point was that I rechecked my own actions and stopped trusting visual confirmations. The green Tilda save banner was only a UI signal, not proof of persistence or publication.
- Reusable solution:
  - Native payment layer: ST100/T-Bank.
  - Custom page bridge: `tcart__addProduct` -> `tcart__reDrawCartIcon` -> `tcart__openCart`.
  - Anti-duplication step: clear stale cart products before adding the current product.
  - Persistence check: write through Ace editor, reopen HEAD, then publish.
  - Readiness check: live HTML -> browser cart -> checkout button -> `pay.tbank.ru` card-entry page.
- New rule:
  - For Tilda payment tasks, do not report success from screenshots, editor messages, or partial cart opening. Success requires provider-page verification up to card-entry screen, without submitting a real payment unless explicitly approved.

## 2026-05-09 20:59 MSK — Fast Continuation Chat Started

- Project: Moonn / Tilda site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user opened a new Codex chat to continue the prior Moonn/Tilda payment workstream without the slowdown from the old heavy chat, while keeping the old chat as archive.
- Context read:
  - `docs/codex-handoffs/2026-05-09-fast-restart-moonn-payment.md`
  - latest 2026-05-09 entries from `docs/codex-chat-history.md`
- Confirmed state:
  - Repository is `C:\пайто н тесты\Ано_институт_глаболизация\moon-psy-site`.
  - Active branch is `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
  - Latest commit is `822e1ad` — `Add fast restart handoff for Moonn payment`.
  - Remaining local untracked files are the three pre-existing PNG verification screenshots in `docs/teen-psychology-camp-2026/`.
- Decision:
  - Continue Moonn/Tilda work in this chat on the existing canonical branch.
  - Do not create a new repository or duplicate branch for this continuation.
  - Do not read the full old heavy chat unless a specific missing detail cannot be recovered from the handoff, project memory or recovery index.
- Follow-up rule:
  - If this chat becomes slow, create another fast continuation chat from the handoff pattern instead of changing repositories, duplicating branches or reloading raw chat archives.

## 2026-05-09 — Moonn Yandex Services Reviews SEO Restart

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user returned from Timepad workstream to the older SEO workstream about connecting Moonn site visibility with the Yandex Services profile `Татьяна Кумскова (Мунн)` and asked to build/strengthen a reviews page on `moonn.ru`.
- Context checked:
  - Active automation `moonn-seo-leftovers-morning-check`, which listed Yandex Services reviews/profile synchronization as a blocked SEO item.
  - Existing live page `https://moonn.ru/otzivi`.
  - Local schema and SEO packets in `assets/moonn-schema-layer.js`, `scripts/build_moonn_schema_layer.py`, and `docs/moonn-schema-layer-packet-2026-05-08.*`.
- Verified facts:
  - `https://moonn.ru/otzivi` already exists and returned `200`.
  - The page already contains client reviews with Yandex Services source links.
  - The page still includes weak public wording such as `дублирую информацию` and `поиска информации в интернете`.
  - The working Yandex Services profile resolves as `https://uslugi.yandex.ru/profile/TatyanaKumskovamunn-948629`.
- Decision:
  - Do not create a duplicate reviews page and do not mirror the Yandex Services profile one-to-one.
  - Keep `/otzivi` as the canonical reviews page and strengthen it with source links, profile provenance, schema, and user-facing editorial wording.
  - Supersede the 2026-05-04 assumption that `TatyanaKumskovatatyanamunn-948629` was canonical; 2026-05-09 live check showed `TatyanaKumskovamunn-948629` as the working profile path.
- Local artifacts changed/prepared:
  - `data/site.json`
  - `scripts/build_moonn_schema_layer.py`
  - `assets/moonn-schema-layer.js`
  - `assets/moonn-yandex-reviews-quality-layer.js`
  - `docs/moonn-schema-layer-packet-2026-05-08.json`
  - `docs/moonn-schema-layer-packet-2026-05-08.md`
  - `docs/moonn-global-head-code-with-schema-2026-05-08.html`
  - `docs/moonn-yandex-services-reviews-seo-packet-2026-05-09.md`
- Risk / limitation:
  - The rendered JS quality layer can remove weak wording visually after deployment, but raw Tilda HTML still needs native source cleanup for the strongest SEO/compliance result.
  - Live Tilda HEAD currently pins schema scripts to an older commit; Git changes require a scoped Tilda HEAD update and page publish before they affect `moonn.ru`.
- Follow-up rule:
  - Public review pages must not expose internal SEO rationale. Use trust/provenance wording, source links, and structured data, and avoid synthetic ratings or unsupported review counts.

## 2026-05-09 23:05 MSK — Moonn Yandex Services Reviews SEO Live Applied

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: continue the Yandex Services reviews SEO task to actual Tilda/live deployment, not just local packet preparation.
- Actions:
  - Hardened `assets/moonn-schema-layer.js` so the current page-specific schema layer updates an existing `script#moonn-page-schema-jsonld` instead of silently no-oping when an older global schema node exists.
  - Hardened `assets/moonn-yandex-reviews-quality-layer.js` so the Yandex Services source panel can attach to Tilda text elements and patched review text, not only native `h1/h2`.
  - Saved Tilda page-specific HEAD for page `81167556` with commit `b9930a83da11cdbfaeae98a9f92309fe1d2d4464`.
  - Published only page `81167556`.
- Verification:
  - Raw live `https://moonn.ru/otzivi` returned `200`.
  - Raw live HTML contains `moonn-yandex-reviews-quality-layer` and pinned commit `b9930a83da11cdbfaeae98a9f92309fe1d2d4464`.
  - Wrong typo commit `ba39941e95b8a623a7566ba58d281d34e8a16a13` is absent.
  - Rendered Playwright check: `script#moonn-page-schema-jsonld` has `data-moonn-schema-path="/otzivi"` and `data-moonn-schema-updated="true"`.
  - Rendered JSON-LD includes `Person`, `WebSite`, `WebPage`, `ProfilePage`, `ItemList`, `BreadcrumbList`.
  - Rendered JSON-LD includes `https://moonn.ru/otzivi#yandex-services-profile` and `https://moonn.ru/otzivi#verified-yandex-review-summaries`.
  - Rendered page includes the panel `Проверяемые отзывы с Яндекс Услуг`.
  - Rendered page no longer shows `дублирую информацию` or `поиска информации в интернете`.
- Remaining risk / follow-up:
  - Raw Tilda HTML still contains the old weak phrases and the older Yandex profile URL variant. The runtime layer corrects the rendered page, but a native Tilda block cleanup remains the stronger final SEO/compliance state.
- Commits:
  - `b9930a8` — `Harden Yandex reviews runtime layers`
- Follow-up rule:
  - When a global runtime layer and a page-specific runtime layer both write the same DOM node, the page-specific layer must update/replace stale node content and expose a verification attribute, not silently skip.

## 2026-05-09 — Moonn Yandex Services All Reviews Requirement

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user clarified that `/otzivi` must include all reviews, not only four or five selected examples.
- Verification:
  - Rendered Yandex Services profile showed `190 оценок`.
  - Browser scan collected `136` unique visible public text-review records from the paginated reviews section.
  - `190 оценок` is not the same as `190` text reviews; some Yandex ratings may not expose public review text.
- Decision:
  - Treat “all reviews” as all public text reviews visible on Yandex Services at scan time.
  - Do not hard-code a handful of summaries as the final state.
  - Do not publish the full verbatim external review corpus to `moonn.ru` or GitHub until legal/platform/personal-data gate is passed.
- Artifact:
  - `docs/moonn-yandex-services-all-reviews-scan-2026-05-09.md`
- Follow-up rule:
  - Review pages need a canonical review manifest and count-verification gate. Selected summaries are acceptable only as an interim SEO/provenance layer, not as the complete reviews page.

## 2026-05-10 — Moonn Reviews Page Runtime Regression Fixed

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user opened `https://moonn.ru/otzivi` and pointed out that the page showed only the Yandex source panel, not the actual reviews.
- Root cause:
  - `assets/moonn-yandex-reviews-quality-layer.js` searched broad `div` containers for weak SEO phrases and replaced `innerHTML`.
  - On the Tilda page this matched a large page container, so the runtime layer removed the visible original reviews and left only the source panel.
- Fix:
  - Removed destructive text replacement from the review quality layer.
  - Kept only a non-destructive source/provenance panel insertion.
  - Re-pinned Tilda page-specific HEAD for page `81167556` to commit `ca82ebe2e33335c04f6bf05245b8630e9c25c759`.
  - Published only page `81167556`.
- Verification:
  - Live raw HTML contains commit `ca82ebe2e33335c04f6bf05245b8630e9c25c759`.
  - Previous runtime commit `b9930a83da11cdbfaeae98a9f92309fe1d2d4464` is absent from live HTML.
  - Playwright rendered check found the original hero and review names/text again.
  - Manual browser scroll showed visible review cards with source text and links.
- Commit:
  - `ca82ebe` — `Stop destructive Yandex reviews patching`
- Follow-up rule:
  - Runtime content patches on Tilda must not replace `innerHTML` of broad containers (`div`, record wrappers, body-level sections). Use additive overlays or leaf-node-only changes with tight length/class guards and visual verification.

## 2026-05-10 — Moonn Yandex Reviews 2026 Archive Layer Published

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user noticed that the live `/otzivi` page started with 2025 reviews and missed newer Yandex Services reviews from 2026; user also asked for a clearer Yandex Services source block and removal of the dark first review block.
- Actions:
  - Added `assets/moonn-yandex-all-reviews-layer.js`.
  - Updated `assets/moonn-yandex-reviews-quality-layer.js` to:
    - place a light Yandex Services provenance block near the top;
    - keep the profile block before reviews;
    - hide the dark legacy hero block `rec1353100721`;
    - avoid destructive HTML replacement.
  - Published Tilda page-specific HEAD for page `81167556` with commit `9df3edab278d5c27dbc98e2216de692ae247da6f`.
  - Published only page `81167556`.
- Verification:
  - Local browser preview before publication found the order: intro -> Yandex Services panel -> profile -> all-reviews layer -> native Tilda review cards.
  - Live raw HTML contains both `moonn-yandex-reviews-quality-layer` and `moonn-yandex-all-reviews-layer` pinned to commit `9df3edab278d5c27dbc98e2216de692ae247da6f`.
  - Live rendered Playwright check found `123` review summary cards, including 2026 dates `15.04.2026`, `05.04.2026`, and `28.02.2026`.
  - Live rendered page contains the Yandex Services badge and `актуальные отзывы 2026`.
  - Live rendered page hides the dark legacy hero block (`display: none`).
- Commit:
  - `9df3eda` — `Add Yandex reviews archive layer`
- Risk / limitation:
  - The full verbatim Yandex review corpus is still not republished because the legal/platform/personal-data gate for copying external review text remains unresolved. The published layer uses summary cards with source links.
- Follow-up rule:
  - For external-review archive pages, publish the user-facing trust layer as summaries plus source links until the full-text republication gate is explicitly cleared.

## 2026-05-10 — Moonn Reviews Link And Code-Leak Incident Fixed

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user reported two live defects on `/otzivi`:
  - internal escaped HEAD/script code was visible at the top of the public page;
  - review-card links opened Yandex reviewer profiles instead of Tatyana Munn's Yandex Services profile.
- Root cause:
  - The previous validation checked card count and 2026 dates but did not click/inspect card link destinations.
  - The Tilda page contained an escaped legacy page-specific HEAD payload as a body text node; runtime scripts could not remove it until the correct commit hash was published.
  - A wrong full commit hash was briefly written into Tilda HEAD even though the short hash looked correct.
- Fix:
  - Updated `assets/moonn-yandex-all-reviews-layer.js` so every review-card link points to `https://uslugi.yandex.ru/profile/TatyanaKumskovamunn-948629`.
  - Updated `assets/moonn-yandex-reviews-quality-layer.js` to remove leaked escaped HEAD text nodes from rendered `body`.
  - Hid empty decorative Tilda block `rec1353368171`, which visually overlapped the Yandex source panel.
  - Republished Tilda page `81167556` with the correct commit `8739444484729fb768f29522ef6e7a16bf06299b`.
- Verification:
  - Live rendered Playwright check found no visible `moonn-radiant-sanctuary-theme:start` or `cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/rublevalexandermsu-design/moonn-psy-pages` leak text.
  - Live rendered page still has the Yandex source panel and `123` review cards.
  - Live rendered check found `0` review-card links pointing to `reviews.yandex.ru/user`.
  - First 10 sampled card links all point to `https://uslugi.yandex.ru/profile/TatyanaKumskovamunn-948629`.
  - Decorative divider block `rec1353368171` is `display: none`.
- Commit:
  - `8739444` — `Fix Yandex reviews public links and leaked code`
- Follow-up rule:
  - Public-page validation for review archives must include link-destination checks, visible-code leak checks, and exact full commit hash verification, not only card count and text/date presence.

## 2026-05-10 — Moonn Reviews Exact Excerpt Layer Published

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user reported that the `/otzivi` review cards were semantic paraphrases, not the review texts, and asked for the pink/lilac background plus exact per-review Yandex links where possible.
- Root cause:
  - The previous archive layer optimized for a safe summary/provenance format and passed count/link checks, but the validation gate did not distinguish exact review text from generated meaning.
  - The Yandex scan contains reviewer-profile URLs, not verified stable URLs for individual reviews; using reviewer-profile URLs was the wrong destination.
  - Tilda/Ace can keep separate visible-editor and hidden-textarea values, so saving must be followed by raw live HTML and rendered browser checks.
- Fix:
  - Added `scripts/build_moonn_yandex_all_reviews_layer.js`, a deterministic builder from `output/yandex-services-reviews-scan-2026-05-09.json`.
  - Regenerated `assets/moonn-yandex-all-reviews-layer.js` with exact source excerpts rather than paraphrases.
  - Removed public use of `reviews.yandex.ru/user` reviewer-profile links.
  - Kept a pink/lilac/light-blue gradient background for the archive layer.
  - Republished Tilda page `81167556` with runtime layers pinned to commit `bc10db72289925361507bfee71b6d2c6d854b8c4`.
- Verification:
  - CDN asset for commit `bc10db72289925361507bfee71b6d2c6d854b8c4` returns `200`, contains `132` `excerpt` records, contains no generated summary phrases, and contains no `reviews.yandex.ru/user` URLs.
  - Live raw HTML contains `bc10db72289925361507bfee71b6d2c6d854b8c4` and no old `17c88b3e6933a5194642f9005d5be2566cd6609a`.
  - Live rendered Playwright check found `132` cards, `0` reviewer-profile links, no visible internal code, no generated summary phrases, no Yandex UI noise text, and a pink/lilac/light-blue gradient.
  - First rendered review text starts with the exact scanned source fragment: `Хожу к Татьяне на бесплатные лекции))`.
  - Screenshot proof: `output/moonn-otzivi-live-excerpt-verify-2026-05-10.png`.
- Risk / limitation:
  - Exact per-review deep links are not implemented because the collected source does not contain verified stable review URLs; cards honestly link to Tatyana Munn's Yandex Services profile until exact review URLs are verified.
  - Live raw Tilda HEAD still contains an extra closing `</script> </script>` tail after the page-specific HEAD block. It is not visible and does not break rendered checks, but it remains a Tilda/Ace cleanup item.
  - Full verbatim mirroring of all review texts remains behind the legal/platform/personal-data gate; the current public layer uses exact excerpts from the collected visible text.
- Commit:
  - `bc10db7` — `Render Yandex review excerpts from scan`
- Follow-up rule:
  - Review-page releases must validate semantic fidelity (`exact excerpt` vs `generated summary`), source-link type (`provider profile` vs `reviewer profile` vs `verified review permalink`), raw HEAD cleanliness, and rendered browser output before reporting completion.

## 2026-05-10 — Moonn Timepad Consultation MVP Draft Created

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site and Timepad promotion.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user approved a minimal MVP for paid psychological consultations through Timepad, with email/manual notification for Rublev and later iClient/YCLIENTS mirroring.
- Strategic decision:
  - Use Timepad as the visible booking/payment layer, not a page that primarily sends users to iClient/YCLIENTS, because Timepad moderation may treat an external paid-booking link as bypass.
  - Keep iClient/YCLIENTS as the specialist's working calendar, but mirror paid Timepad orders manually in the MVP.
  - Future stronger architecture: Timepad `order_change` webhook -> registry/notification -> iClient/YCLIENTS booking/blocking.
- Action:
  - Created draft Timepad event in Tatyana Munn's personal organization `426753` / `moonn`.
  - Draft event: `https://moonn.timepad.ru/event/3973843/`.
  - Status verified by API: `access_status=draft`, `moderation_status=not_moderated`.
  - Initial placeholder slot: 2026-05-18 12:00-14:00 MSK.
  - Tickets: 2-hour consultation `10 000 ₽`, 1-hour consultation `6 000 ₽`, package of 5 consultations `40 000 ₽`.
- Artifact:
  - `docs/timepad-consultation-mvp-2026-05-10.md`
- Verification:
  - Timepad API returned event id `3973843`.
  - Read-back via Timepad API confirmed organization `426753`, category `Психология и самопознание`, draft status, location, prices and total ticket limit `1`.
- Known limitations before publication:
  - Poster image is not uploaded yet.
  - Slot schedule is not yet synced against iClient/YCLIENTS.
  - Custom registration questions need UI verification because Timepad API rejected custom `field_id` values.
  - Event is not published and not submitted as complete.
- Follow-up rule:
  - Paid Timepad consultation pages are not ready until the slot schedule is checked against the specialist's working calendar and the registration/payment path is verified in the UI. API-created drafts must still pass Timepad UI checks before publication.

## 2026-05-10 — Moonn Timepad Consultation Event Published With Poster

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site and Timepad promotion.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user provided a poster image for the consultation event and asked to rename it with SEO-style Latin filename, attach it to the Timepad event, publish the event, verify paid/public status, open the page, and prepare support text.
- Actions:
  - Copied the supplied image to `assets/timepad/tatyana-munn-psychological-consultation-msu-online-offline-moscow-timepad-2026.png`.
  - Pushed the image to GitHub and verified CDN availability through jsDelivr.
  - Updated Timepad event `3973843` through API with the poster and `access_status=public`.
  - Opened the public event page in the browser.
- Verification:
  - Timepad API confirmed `status=ok`, `access_status=public`, `moderation_status=not_moderated`.
  - Timepad API confirmed paid range `6000-40000`, registration open, total ticket limit `1`, and three active paid ticket types.
  - Public URL `https://moonn.timepad.ru/event/3973843/` returned HTTP `200`.
  - Public HTML contains event title, poster marker, and prices `6 000`, `10 000`, `40 000`.
- Commit:
  - `d991bfa` — `Add Timepad consultation poster`
- Risk / limitation:
  - The event is public but still `not_moderated`, so Timepad support/Afisha approval is not yet complete.
  - Custom questionnaire fields still need Timepad UI verification because API rejected custom question field ids.
  - iClient/YCLIENTS slot reconciliation remains required before scaling beyond this first slot.
- Follow-up rule:
  - Timepad publication is not fully complete at `access_status=public`; for business readiness, also verify paid prices on the public page, poster, moderation status, and calendar/slot reconciliation.

## 2026-05-10 — Moonn Timepad Consultation Address And Recurring Schedule Path

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site and Timepad promotion.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user noticed that the public Timepad event showed an ambiguous place (`метро Марьина Роща / онлайн`) and asked to show a real address on the map; user also asked how participants can choose dates through the end of the year.
- Fix:
  - Updated Timepad event `3973843` through API to use `Москва, Цветной бульвар, д. 19, стр. 4`.
  - Added the same address to the public description.
- Verification:
  - API read-back confirmed city `Москва`, address `Москва, Цветной бульвар, д. 19, стр. 4`, `status=ok`, `access_status=public`, registration open, paid prices `6000/10000/40000`.
  - Public HTML check returned `200`, contains the address, no longer contains the vague `метро Марьина Роща / онлайн` wording, contains a map link, and still contains paid prices.
- Recurring schedule decision:
  - Do not mass-create many independent weekly duplicate events by API.
  - Use Timepad's master-event/schedule mechanism for weekly consultation slots from 2026-05-18 through 2026-12-28 inclusive.
  - Ask Timepad to use calendar-style schedule display if available, so visitors can choose a date visually.
  - Official Timepad help says the schedule/master-event option is connected by writing to support with the first event link; this matches the support route for the current event.
- Follow-up rule:
  - For paid consultation scheduling, prefer one Timepad master event with session slots and capacity `1` over many standalone cloned events; independent copies create moderation, duplicate, and calendar-sync risk.

## 2026-05-10 — Moonn Timepad Consultation Reception Days Correction

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site and Timepad promotion.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user corrected the schedule assumption: Tatyana currently consults on Tuesday, Saturday, and Sunday, not Monday; a single fixed slot does not let visitors choose a suitable time.
- Fix:
  - Updated Timepad event `3973843` through API from `2026-05-18 12:00-14:00` to `2026-05-16 12:00-14:00`.
  - Updated public short and full descriptions to say consultations are held on Tuesday, Saturday, and Sunday.
  - Updated the support request model: ask Timepad for schedule/master-event slots across reception days with selectable dates and times, not one Monday recurring slot.
  - Removed internal `technical first date` wording from the public page and replaced it with client-facing fallback text: if the desired time is not visible, the organizer helps choose a suitable time in the reception days.
- Verification:
  - API read-back confirmed `starts_at=2026-05-16T12:00:00+03:00`, `ends_at=2026-05-16T14:00:00+03:00`, address `Москва, Цветной бульвар, д. 19, стр. 4`, `access_status=public`, `moderation_status=not_moderated`.
  - Public HTML check returned `200`, contains Tuesday/weekend wording, address, paid prices, and no internal `technical` / `MVP` wording.
- Tooling note:
  - Gmail connector install/activation was requested but not completed in this session, so email sending is still blocked without manual browser use.
- Follow-up rule:
  - Consultation schedule assumptions must be verified against the current iClient/YCLIENTS calendar before publication or support submission; Timepad support requests should ask for multiple selectable reception-day slots.

## 2026-05-10 — Moonn Timepad Support Email Sent

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site and Timepad promotion.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user explicitly asked to send the support email to Timepad after the consultation reception days were corrected.
- Action:
  - Gmail connector became available after tool discovery.
  - Sent email from `rublevalexandermsu@gmail.com` to `support@timepad.ru`.
  - Subject: `Просим проверить консультацию психолога Татьяны Мунн и подключить расписание`.
  - Message asked Timepad to check event `https://moonn.timepad.ru/event/3973843/` and connect schedule/master-event mode for Tuesday, Saturday, and Sunday consultation slots through the end of 2026.
- Verification:
  - Gmail send response returned message id `19e1152a116ae61a`, thread id `19e1152a116ae61a`, label `SENT`.
- Follow-up:
  - Wait for Timepad response or moderation result.
  - If Timepad asks for a different technical format, update the Timepad event and this project history before resubmitting.

## 2026-05-10 — Moonn Homepage Replacement Experiment Routed

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user asked how to publish and test an older/newer local HTML page without replacing the currently ranking homepage.
- Checked facts:
  - Current live homepage `https://moonn.ru/` returns `200`, has title/description, self-canonical to `/`, and detected JSON-LD.
  - Candidate local HTML file exists outside the repository and has one H1 and many sections, but no detected title, description, canonical or robots meta.
  - Candidate page contains internal setup text and incomplete Timepad/WhatsApp instructions, so it is not safe to publish as-is.
- Decision:
  - Do not replace the root homepage now.
  - Use a same-domain semantic experimental landing instead of a new domain or duplicate root page.
  - Clean the local HTML, choose a semantic URL, add metadata/schema, and publish only after content/legal/SEO/visual QA.
- Artifact:
  - `docs/moonn-homepage-experiment-plan-2026-05-10.md`
- Follow-up rule:
  - Alternative homepages must be launched as semantic same-domain experiments with clear search intent, self-canonical only when materially unique, and Metrica/Search Console measurement before any root homepage migration.

## 2026-05-10 — Moonn Homepage Experiment Candidate Switched

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user clarified that `Окончательный.код.сай..html` is the better working page and should be used instead of `Сайт.6..резервный.последний.копия.html`.
- Checked facts:
  - New candidate exists at `C:\пайтонннн.. тесты\код сайт татьяна мунн\Коды для сайта татьяны.готовые\Окончательный.код.сай..html`.
  - File size: `113006` bytes; last modified `2026-02-15`.
  - Detected one H1, sixteen H2 sections and one JSON-LD block.
  - No detected title, meta description, canonical or robots meta.
  - Internal hints reduced to `3`, but one visible setup instruction remains: `Если Тильда позволяет - перенеси <title>, meta description, og:* в HEAD страницы.`
  - Page contains real Timepad links for the lecture carousel, but consultation booking/payment text still uses Telegram/WhatsApp/card/SBP and must be aligned with the newer Timepad paid booking route.
- Decision:
  - Use `Окончательный.код.сай..html` as the primary candidate for the same-domain SEO landing experiment.
  - Demote the previous `Сайт.6..резервный.последний.копия.html` candidate.
- Artifact updated:
  - `docs/moonn-homepage-experiment-plan-2026-05-10.md`.

## 2026-05-10 — Moonn Psychologist SEO Landing Published

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user approved building and publishing the additional SEO/AI/EE optimized page from `Окончательный.код.сай..html`, keeping the current homepage intact.
- Route:
  - Continued the existing additional semantic URL `https://moonn.ru/psiholog-tatiana-moonn` instead of replacing `/` or creating a duplicate domain.
  - Cleaned the local HTML into a deterministic generated artifact.
  - Published through the native Tilda `T123` record `rec1863545891` on page `115095616`, not through a HEAD takeover.
- Changes:
  - Removed old visible setup hints and legacy payment modal markers.
  - Replaced consultation payment CTAs with direct iClient/YCLIENTS booking: `https://n461584.yclients.com/`.
  - Replaced old embedded YouTube video IDs with the current YouTube channel link: `https://youtube.com/channel/UCyAQlNoDtg7En6BdwbctSrQ`.
  - Added SEO title, description, canonical, JSON-LD and Yandex Metrika click goals for iClient/YouTube/reviews.
- Artifacts:
  - `scripts/build_moonn_psychologist_landing_experiment.py`
  - `docs/psychologist-tatiana-munn-landing/tilda-html-block-final.html`
  - `docs/psychologist-tatiana-munn-landing/tilda-page-final.html`
  - `docs/psychologist-tatiana-munn-landing/tilda-head-seo-final.html`
  - `docs/psychologist-tatiana-munn-landing/tilda-head-loader-final.html`
  - `docs/psychologist-tatiana-munn-landing/quality-report.json`
  - `docs/psychologist-tatiana-munn-landing/publication-report-2026-05-10.md`
- Verification:
  - Local quality report: title/description/canonical present, H1 count `1`, JSON-LD count `1`, iClient present, YouTube channel present, old YouTube embeds `0`, visible/raw internal hits `0`.
  - Tilda API after publish: `meta_title` and `meta_descr` updated; HTML contains iClient and YouTube channel; old setup hint and old YouTube embed IDs absent.
  - Live HTML `https://moonn.ru/psiholog-tatiana-moonn?qa=final`: status `200`, title updated, canonical correct, H1 count `1`, JSON-LD count `3`, iClient links `17`, YouTube channel present, old YouTube IDs absent, legacy payment modal markers absent.
  - Desktop headless Chrome visual QA confirmed the new page renders publicly with the Moonn cookie/compliance layer.
- Commits:
  - `4c38497` — `Add Moonn psychologist SEO landing artifact`
  - `72ac8de` — `Add Tilda loader for psychologist landing`
- Follow-up rule:
  - For this page type, prefer native Tilda `T123` block replacement over HEAD document replacement when the page already consists of a single canonical HTML block. HEAD loaders remain fallback artifacts, not the primary publication route.

## 2026-05-10 — Moonn Psychologist Landing Summary Card Removed

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user asked to remove the visible top block `Кратко о консультациях` and verify SEO after deletion.
- Route:
  - Kept the same canonical additional landing URL: `https://moonn.ru/psiholog-tatiana-moonn`.
  - Updated the generator rather than manually deleting the block only in Tilda, so future regenerations do not restore the removed section.
  - Published through native Tilda `T123` record `rec1863545891` on page `115095616`.
- Changes:
  - Added deterministic removal of the `#ai-summary` section before the hero.
  - Regenerated `docs/psychologist-tatiana-munn-landing/tilda-html-block-final.html`, `tilda-page-final.html`, and `quality-report.json`.
  - Added visual QA artifact `docs/psychologist-tatiana-munn-landing/visual-remove-summary-2026-05-10.png`.
  - Updated `docs/psychologist-tatiana-munn-landing/publication-report-2026-05-10.md`.
- Verification:
  - Local generated artifacts: no `Кратко о консультациях` / `ai-summary` matches outside the removal rule in the generator.
  - Local quality report: title/description/canonical present, H1 count `1`, JSON-LD count `1`, iClient present, YouTube channel present, old YouTube embeds `0`, visible/raw internal hits `0`.
  - Tilda editor save confirmation: block length `89843`, `hasSummary=false`, `hasHero=true`.
  - Tilda API after publish: `has_summary=false`, iClient present, YouTube channel present, old YouTube embeds absent, legacy payment markers absent.
  - Live HTML `https://moonn.ru/psiholog-tatiana-moonn?qa=remove-summary-1778414288`: status `200`, title unchanged, canonical correct, H1 count `1`, JSON-LD count `3`, iClient present, YouTube channel present, old YouTube IDs absent, legacy payment markers absent.
  - Visual Edge/browser check confirmed the page starts with the hero block and the removed top summary card is absent.
- Follow-up rule:
  - For public Tilda pages, visual deletion requests must be implemented in the generator/source artifact first, then published, then verified through Tilda API, live HTML, and browser render.

## 2026-05-20 — Moonn SEO/Privacy Supervisor Automation Restored

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Workstream: SEO/AEO supervisor and privacy/RKN compliance follow-up.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user reported that the previous chat became too slow and asked to find the SEO branch and recreate the morning automation in Russian.
- Verified facts:
  - The canonical Moonn repository is `C:\пайто н тесты\Ано_институт_глаболизация\moon-psy-site`.
  - The SEO/RKN workstream history is in this file and points to `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
  - Related but separate branches exist: `codex/moonn-seo-positioning-architecture` for noindex/positioning, `codex/moonn-homepage-reviews-banner` for the reviews funnel, and `codex/moonn-paid-video-lectures` for paid lectures.
  - No existing active Moonn SEO automation was found in `C:\Users\yanta\.codex\automations`.
- Created automation:
  - ID: `moonn-seo-privacy-supervisor`.
  - Name: `Moonn SEO и privacy supervisor`.
  - Schedule: daily from `2026-05-21 09:00` Moscow time.
  - CWD: `C:\пайто н тесты\Ано_институт_глаболизация\moon-psy-site`.
  - Prompt language: Russian only.
- Scope:
  - Continue from existing reports and registries before new actions.
  - Check MIIIIPS PR #11, Moonn reindexing, 83-page SEO audit/classification, Yandex Services/MSU Istina blockers, and paid video lecture pause.
  - Run weekly privacy/RKN checks on Mondays or when explicitly requested.
- Safety gates:
  - No live Tilda changes, legal publication, personal data, screenshots, payment changes, private video links, RKN notification, bot-blocking rules, or mass Google URL Inspection resubmission without approval.
- Follow-up rule:
  - Supervisor runs must start from `codex/moonn-seo-audit` context and must not mix SEO/RKN work with reviews, paid videos, or other Moonn branches.

## 2026-05-20 — Moonn SEO Growth Supervisor Manual Run

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Workstream: SEO/AEO growth evidence and analytics access.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user asked to run the restored automation immediately and determine whether three weeks of SEO work produced traffic/search improvements.
- Actions:
  - Ran `python scripts\moonn_final_seo_audit.py --production-scope`.
  - Ran `python scripts\moonn_privacy_compliance_audit.py`.
  - Ran `python scripts\moonn_rendered_heading_audit.py`.
  - Ran `python scripts\moonn_rendered_schema_audit.py`.
  - Checked Yandex.Metrika API, Yandex Webmaster API and Google Search Console API access.
  - Created SEO growth report and backlog.
- Verified:
  - `83/83` production URLs returned HTTP `200`.
  - Rendered H1: `83/83` pages have exactly one H1; `2` H2 target checks failed on `psypodgotovka1`.
  - Rendered schema: `83/83` pages have JSON-LD and no JSON errors.
  - Yandex.Metrika API returned `403 access_denied`.
  - Yandex Webmaster API returned `403 INVALID_OAUTH_TOKEN`.
  - Google Search Console API returned `401 Login Required`.
- Created / changed files:
  - `docs/moonn-seo-growth-check-2026-05-20.md`
  - `docs/moonn-seo-growth-backlog.md`
  - `docs/moonn-production-scope-seo-audit-2026-05-20.*`
  - `docs/moonn-rendered-heading-audit-2026-05-20.*`
  - `docs/moonn-rendered-schema-audit-2026-05-20.*`
  - `docs/moonn-privacy-compliance-audit-2026-05-20.*`
  - `scripts/moonn_privacy_compliance_audit.py`
  - `scripts/moonn_rendered_heading_audit.py`
  - `scripts/moonn_rendered_schema_audit.py`
- Incident:
  - Symptom: several audit scripts wrote new run results into old dated files such as `2026-05-06` and `2026-05-08`.
  - Root cause: output filenames were hard-coded to the original rollout dates.
  - Fix: changed output paths and Markdown headers to use the current UTC run date.
  - Follow-up rule: supervisor audits must write append-only dated artifacts and must not overwrite historical evidence.
- Decision:
  - The SEO rollout is technically real and live, but traffic impact is not verified until Yandex.Metrika/GSC analytics data is accessible or exported.

## 2026-05-20 — Moonn SEO Growth GUI Analytics Correction

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Workstream: SEO/AEO growth evidence and analytics access.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user corrected that missing API tokens should not stop the analysis; Codex must use Google Chrome Rublev profile when GUI cabinet access is available.
- Correction:
  - Continued the same workstream through the Chrome profile associated with Rublev access.
  - Used authenticated GUI views for Yandex.Metrika, Google Search Console and Yandex Webmaster.
  - Kept screenshots as local working evidence and did not commit them because they contain account/cabinet UI.
- Verified via GUI:
  - Yandex.Metrika counter `96397286`, period `21 Apr 2026 - 20 May 2026`: sources report `313` visits and `265` visitors.
  - Metrika sources: direct `205`, search engines `81`, referral links `24`, social networks `2`, internal transitions `1`.
  - Metrika search phrases: `38` visits and `33` visitors; visible phrases include `татьяна мунн`, `татьяна мунн сколько стоит`, `татьянка мунн лекции`, `что такое самоосознанность`.
  - Metrika popular content report: `901` views and `268` visitors, but visible page data collapses to `https://moonn.ru/`.
  - Google Search Console for `https://moonn.ru/`, last `28 days`: `64` clicks, `4.41K` impressions, CTR `1.5%`, average position `8.7`.
  - GSC top pages include `article_diary_of_emotions`, homepage, `article_femininity`, `lectures1`, social-intelligence content, `schematherapy`, and `physiotherapy`.
  - Yandex Webmaster dashboard: `0` errors, `1` recommendation, `9` duplicate titles, `22` duplicate descriptions.
- Changed files:
  - `docs/moonn-seo-growth-check-2026-05-20.md`
- Incident:
  - Symptom: first report treated blocked APIs as a hard stop for business analytics.
  - Root cause: fallback route through authenticated Chrome GUI was not executed before reporting.
  - Fix: reran the analytics evidence step through Chrome GUI and updated the report.
  - Follow-up rule: when analytics APIs are blocked but an authenticated Chrome profile is available, the supervisor must use GUI capture as a bounded fallback and clearly separate API-blocked from GUI-verified facts.

## 2026-05-20 — Moonn SEO Before/After Analytics Clarification

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Workstream: SEO/AEO growth evidence and analytics access.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user questioned whether the `316` visits were really for one month and asked for a proper before/after SEO interpretation.
- Verified dates:
  - `2026-05-01`: analytics baseline recorded; Metrika counter `96397286` had `1` visit / `1` view / `1` visitor for `2026-04-25 - 2026-05-01`; GSC last 3 months had `221` clicks and `12.4K` impressions.
  - `2026-05-04`: production SEO settings were applied through Tilda UI to `77` ready pages plus `3` formerly robots-blocked pages.
  - `2026-05-07`: H1/H2 and publish follow-up work; history records broken Yandex.Metrika script before final publication path.
  - `2026-05-08`: JSON-LD/schema rollout and GSC/Yandex reindex submission were recorded.
- GUI recheck:
  - Metrika `month` preset was confirmed as `21 Apr - 20 May`, not 9 months.
  - Metrika before core SEO application, `2026-04-20 - 2026-05-03`: traffic report `4` visits; sources report `1` attributed visit.
  - Metrika after rollout window, `2026-05-07 - 2026-05-20`: traffic report `312` visits; sources report `312` visits / `264` visitors.
  - After-window sources: direct `204`, search engines `81`, referral links `24`, social networks `2`, internal `1`.
- Interpretation:
  - The Metrika jump is real as tracked traffic, but not pure SEO uplift because the Metrika snippet/instrumentation was also repaired during the workstream.
  - GSC remains the cleaner SEO signal; the May 20 GUI check showed last-28-days `64` clicks and `4.41K` impressions with non-brand queries/pages gaining visibility.
- Changed files:
  - `docs/moonn-seo-growth-check-2026-05-20.md`
- Follow-up rule:
  - SEO growth reports must always define rollout date(s), pre-window, post-window, and measurement caveats before claiming impact.

## 2026-05-20 — Moonn GSC Query/Page CTR Clarification

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Workstream: SEO/AEO growth evidence and analytics access.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user asked which pages are visited/shown, which queries produce impressions, why clicks are low, and whether impressions increased after SEO.
- Verified via Google Search Console GUI:
  - Latest `28 days`: `64` clicks, `4.41K` impressions, CTR `1.5%`, average position `8.7`.
  - Pre-rollout comparable `28 days` (`2026-04-06 - 2026-05-03`): `89` clicks, `5.87K` impressions, CTR `1.5%`, average position `6.8`.
  - Pre-rollout `15 days` (`2026-04-19 - 2026-05-03`): `39` clicks, `2.88K` impressions, CTR `1.4%`, average position `8.1`.
  - Post-rollout `15 days` (`2026-05-04 - 2026-05-18`): `30` clicks, `2.1K` impressions, CTR `1.4%`, average position `8.7`.
  - Top last-28-day high-impression queries include `дневник эмоций`, `социальный интеллект это`, `как вести дневник эмоций`, `социальный интеллект`, `муна`, and diary-related variants.
  - Top last-28-day high-impression pages include `article_diary_of_emotions`, social-intelligence knowledge-base, `article_femininity`, homepage, `uslugi_sohranit_brak`, `schematherapy`, `lectures1`, `uslugi_konflikti_na_rabote`, `diagnostika-ei`, and `uslugi_procrastination`.
- Decision:
  - Do not claim GSC growth yet. The site has measurable search visibility, but latest comparable GSC windows are lower than pre-rollout windows.
  - Treat the next SEO iteration as CTR/snippet/intent optimization, not as proof that the first rollout already increased Google clicks.
- Changed files:
  - `docs/moonn-seo-growth-check-2026-05-20.md`
- Follow-up rule:
  - SEO reports must separate visibility, CTR, page-level demand, and conversion instead of compressing them into one "SEO worked" conclusion.

## 2026-05-21 08:53 MSK — Moonn Five-Page SEO/AEO Sprint Implementation Packet

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Workstream: SEO/AEO growth, five-page commercial/trust sprint.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user approved the five-page SEO/AEO/IEO sprint plan and asked to implement it for подростковый лагерь, gallery, exam support, consultations and reviews.
- Strategic decision:
  - Continue route B: five-page SEO sprint with measurable packets, AEO/FAQ/schema layer, click-goal contract and dated ledger.
  - Do not jump directly to a 50+ page content cluster until the five selected pages have clean technical verification and measurement.
- Created artifacts:
  - `scripts/build_moonn_five_page_seo_sprint.py`
  - `scripts/moonn_five_page_seo_sprint_audit.py`
  - `assets/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-layer.js`

  - `docs/moonn-production-scope-seo-audit-2026-05-21.md`
  - `docs/moonn-production-scope-seo-audit-2026-05-21.csv`
- Updated artifacts:
  - `scripts/tilda_page_seo_settings_ui_rollout.py` now supports `--packet`, `--mode pages` and `--dry-run`.
  - `docs/moonn-seo-growth-backlog.md` now includes the five-page Tilda publication, HEAD/AEO, reindex and measurement follow-ups.
- Verification:
  - `python -m py_compile scripts\build_moonn_five_page_seo_sprint.py scripts\moonn_five_page_seo_sprint_audit.py scripts\tilda_page_seo_settings_ui_rollout.py` passed.
  - `python scripts\build_moonn_five_page_seo_sprint.py` generated the packet, ledger, reindex list, head snippet and JS layer.
  - `python scripts\moonn_final_seo_audit.py --production-scope` checked 83 production URLs: 83 HTTP 200.
  - `python scripts\moonn_five_page_seo_sprint_audit.py --packet docs\moonn-five-page-seo-packets-2026-05-21.json --rendered` checked the five URLs.
  - Tilda rollout dry-run selected page ids `140348786`, `140864526`, `62652841`, `135430346`, `81167556`.
- Current T0 result:
  - All five URLs return 200, are in sitemap and are not robots-blocked.
  - Rendered H1 count is already one for all five pages.
  - Raw HTML still needs live publication for updated title/description, AEO answer blocks and source-level cleanup.
  - Missing raw image alt remains on all five pages.
- Blocker:
  - Authenticated Chrome/Tilda window was not available in the current desktop session; `scripts\tilda_page_seo_settings_ui_rollout.py --packet docs\moonn-five-page-seo-packets-2026-05-21.json --mode pages --limit 5` stopped with `No authenticated Google Chrome Tilda window found`.
  - `windows-mcp` desktop tools were not exposed by the current tool search; do not claim live Tilda publication until Chrome/Tilda is actually opened and verified.
- Follow-up rule:
  - Five-page SEO changes must move through packet -> Tilda save/publish -> live HTML/rendered audit -> scoped reindex -> T+14/T+28 ledger update. Do not report SEO implementation as live when only source artifacts were prepared.

## 2026-05-21 — Moonn Five-Page SEO/AEO Tilda Live Publication

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Workstream: SEO/AEO growth, five-page commercial/trust sprint.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user rejected source-only completion and explicitly required Codex to enter Tilda through Alexander/Rublev Google Chrome and implement the SEO plan live.
- Correction:
  - Found the active Chrome window with `rublevalexandermsu@gmail.com`.
  - Updated `scripts/tilda_page_seo_settings_ui_rollout.py` so it can use the Rublev Chrome window even when a Tilda tab is not already open.
  - DevTools console was unavailable in the visible Chrome session, so the rollout path was corrected to use Chrome address-bar `javascript:` execution in the authenticated Tilda context.
- Live changes:
  - Saved SEO title, description, canonical, noindex=false and nofollow=false for the five scoped Tilda pages:
    - `140348786` / `https://moonn.ru/podrostkovyy-lager-psihologiya`
    - `140864526` / `https://moonn.ru/kartiny-tatiany-munn`
    - `62652841` / `https://moonn.ru/psypodgotovka1`
    - `135430346` / `https://moonn.ru/psiholog-konsultacii-moskva`
    - `81167556` / `https://moonn.ru/otzivi`
  - Published only those five pages.
  - Added `scripts/tilda_five_page_head_layer_ui_rollout.py` and used each page's Tilda `editheadcode` / `aceeditor_head` editor to add the five-page AEO/FAQ/schema layer.
  - Published only those five pages again after the HEAD layer save.
- Verification:
  - `output/tilda-five-page-seo-settings-ui-rollout-2026-05-21.json`: 10 successful records, first save pass and second save+publish pass, `0` errors.
  - `output/tilda-five-page-head-layer-ui-rollout-2026-05-21.json`: five successful page HEAD saves and publishes, `0` errors.
  - Raw live HTML contains `moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-layer.js` and commit `49a093e` on all five URLs.
  - `python scripts\moonn_five_page_seo_sprint_audit.py --packet docs\moonn-five-page-seo-packets-2026-05-21.json --rendered`:
    - all five URLs return `200`;
    - all five are in sitemap;
    - none are blocked by robots.txt;
    - rendered H1 count is `1` on all five;
    - rendered AEO answer block count is `1` on all five;
    - rendered placeholders are absent on all five.
- Remaining source-level cleanup:
  - Raw HTML still contains missing alt attributes on all five pages.
  - Camp/gallery still have raw placeholder strings, although rendered placeholders are hidden.
  - Camp/consultations/reviews still have raw H1 issues, although rendered H1 is corrected.
- Follow-up rule:
  - When authenticated Chrome is available, Tilda GUI fallback must be attempted before reporting blocker. If DevTools is unavailable, use verified address-bar `javascript:` execution or Tilda page-specific `editheadcode`/Ace editor flow, then verify live HTML and rendered browser output.

## 2026-05-22 09:00 MSK — Supervisor Run: Five-Page SEO/AEO (Audit + Blockers)

- Ran (non-rendered): `python scripts\\moonn_five_page_seo_sprint_audit.py --packet docs\\moonn-five-page-seo-packets-2026-05-21.json --out-prefix moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-05-22`.
  - Output: `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-05-22.json`, `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-05-22.md`.
- Blocker: `--rendered` fails in this environment (Playwright `WinError 5`, subprocess/pipes denied).
- Blocker: sandbox HTTP fetch returned `http_ERROR` for all five URLs; Windows MCP lightweight fetch hit `403` for 4/5 URLs (non-browser access blocked), while `/otzivi` was fetchable.
- Next action: run the rendered audit + robots/sitemap checks via authenticated Chrome GUI (Rublev profile), then proceed with scoped reindex submission of only `docs/moonn-five-page-reindex-urls-2026-05-21.txt` (no 83-URL batch).
- Risk flag: `/otzivi` public copy includes internal/technical explanatory paragraphs and placeholder-like blocks; keep in backlog until explicit approval for Tilda edits.

## 2026-05-23 09:00 MSK — Supervisor Run: Five-Page SEO/AEO (Rendered Audit OK)

- Ran (non-rendered): `python scripts\\moonn_five_page_seo_sprint_audit.py --packet docs\\moonn-five-page-seo-packets-2026-05-21.json --out-prefix moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-05-23`.
  - Output: `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-05-23.json`, `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-05-23.md`.
- Verified (from this host): HTTP 200 for all five pages; in sitemap; robots not blocked.
- Remaining issues: raw HTML placeholders are still present on 2 pages (camp/gallery); missing `alt` on images remains across all five pages; both require explicit approval for Tilda source edits.
- Blocker: rendered/DOM verification via Playwright is still not confirmed as working in this environment (2026-05-22 recorded Playwright `WinError 5`).
- Next action (unchanged): proceed with scoped reindex of only `docs/moonn-five-page-reindex-urls-2026-05-21.txt` + sitemap if GSC/Yandex Webmaster access is available via API or authenticated Chrome GUI (no 83-URL batch).

## 2026-05-23 — Moonn Teen Camp Visual Regression Correction

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Workstream: teen psychology camp Tilda page, Timepad-facing copy follow-up.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: user reported that after the previous teen-camp page update most visual blocks lost images, the page contained internal/technical public copy, and the five-day program was described as approximate.
- Incident:
  - Symptom: live page screenshots showed blank visual areas after the first block and public copy such as "понятные блоки", "примерная логика", "мы обновили блок", and "готовые файлы для страницы".
  - Root cause: the previous completion report relied on raw HTML and DOM text checks, but did not perform a full scroll-through visual QA pass after changing the Tilda loader/native records.
  - Fix: restored the pre-regression page structure from the existing branch history, kept the original gallery assets, made reveal animation non-blocking by default, rewrote public copy, added a separate daily rhythm block with breaks and lunch, and renamed the five-day section to a direct program.
  - Follow-up rule: for Tilda/frontend publication tasks, do not report ready until the live page has been checked across hero, gallery, program, pricing/payment, and footer by raw HTML, rendered DOM, and visual scroll-through.
- Changed files:
  - `docs/teen-psychology-camp-2026/tilda-page-final.html`
  - `docs/teen-psychology-camp-2026/tilda-html-block-final.html`
  - `docs/teen-psychology-camp-2026/tilda-head-loader-final.html`

## 2026-05-24 09:00 MSK — Supervisor Run: Five-Page SEO/AEO (Rendered Audit + AEO Gap)

- Workstream: Moonn five-page SEO/AEO sprint supervisor (audit-only).
- Branch (canonical): `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Ran (rendered): `python scripts\\moonn_five_page_seo_sprint_audit.py --rendered`.
  - Output: `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-05-24.json`, `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-05-24.md`.
- Verified (from this host):
  - All five URLs: HTTP `200`, sitemap listed, robots not blocked.
  - Rendered H1 count: `1` on all five URLs.
- Regression / scope mismatch:
  - `https://moonn.ru/podrostkovyy-lager-psihologiya` rendered answer block count is `0` (expected `1` for the sprint AEO layer).
- Remaining issues (unchanged):
  - Raw placeholder strings remain on camp/gallery pages.
  - Missing raw image `alt` remains across all five pages.
- Next action (unchanged): scoped reindex submission only for `docs/moonn-five-page-reindex-urls-2026-05-21.txt` (+ sitemap) via GSC/Yandex Webmaster API or authenticated Chrome GUI; do not submit all 83 URLs.

## 2026-06-01 — Supervisor Run: SEO/Growth + Weekly Privacy (DNS-Blocked Evidence)

- Workstream: `moonn-seo-privacy-supervisor` (SEO/AEO + analytics/growth + weekly privacy/RKN).
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-supervisor-20260601` (from `origin/codex/moonn-seo-audit`).
- Verified (this host):
  - DNS resolution for `moonn.ru` is still broken:
    - PowerShell live checks: `Этот хост неизвестен. (moonn.ru:443)` for `/`, `/events_tp`, `/lectures1`, `/psiholog-konsultacii-moskva`, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`.
    - Python preflight (privacy audit): `ERROR:[Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed`.
  - Weekly privacy technical audit produced dated artifacts (fast-fail DNS mode):
    - `docs/moonn-privacy-compliance-audit-2026-06-01.json`
    - `docs/moonn-privacy-compliance-audit-2026-06-01.md`
- Changes (durability):
  - Updated `scripts/moonn_privacy_compliance_audit.py` to preflight `https://moonn.ru/robots.txt` and fast-fail DNS-like outages instead of hanging on 83 URL fetches.
- Reports:
  - Added `docs/moonn-seo-growth-check-2026-06-01.md` (explicitly separates verified facts vs blockers; no analytics claims).
- Not done:
  - No live Tilda edits; no analytics cabinet setting changes; no screenshots captured/committed.
- Blockers / next action:
  - Restore DNS/egress for `moonn.ru` on this host (or run supervisor from a network where it resolves), then rerun live checks and perform bounded Rublev-profile GUI evidence collection for `2026-04-29..today` (Metrika/GSC/Webmaster).

## 2026-05-28 09:00 MSK — Supervisor Run: SEO/AEO + Analytics (DNS + GUI Tooling Blocked)

- Workstream: Moonn SEO-growth + privacy/RKN supervisor (audit-only, no live edits).
- Branch (canonical): `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Ran:
  - `python scripts\\moonn_five_page_seo_sprint_audit.py --packet docs\\moonn-five-page-seo-packets-2026-05-21.json --rendered`
    - Output: `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-05-28.json`, `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-05-28.md`.
- Verified:
  - Infra blocker: this host cannot resolve `moonn.ru` (`Errno 11001 getaddrinfo failed`), so live HTTP/robots/sitemap checks are invalid in this run (audit outputs are `http_ERROR` across all five URLs).
  - GUI tooling blocker: `windows-mcp` failed (`Snapshot` timeout; `Screenshot` transport closed), so bounded Rublev-profile analytics verification could not be performed.
- Outputs:
  - Daily supervisor note: `docs/moonn-seo-growth-check-2026-05-28.md`.
- Notes:
  - Weekly privacy layer was intentionally skipped because today is Thursday (next scheduled weekly privacy run: Monday, 2026-06-01), unless explicitly requested earlier.

## 2026-05-27 09:05 MSK — Supervisor Run: Five-Page SEO/AEO (Rendered Audit)

- Verified (from this host):
  - All five URLs: HTTP `200`, sitemap listed, robots not blocked.
  - Rendered H1 count: `1` on all five URLs.
- Findings / blockers:
  - `P0` Persistent mismatch: `https://moonn.ru/podrostkovyy-lager-psihologiya` rendered answer block count remains `0` (expected `1` for the sprint layer).
  - `P0` Source cleanup remains (approval-required for Tilda edits): raw placeholder text still present on camp + gallery pages; missing image `alt` persists across all five pages.
  - `P1` Raw H1 anomalies persist (camp=0; consultations/reviews=2) even though rendered H1 is `1`.
- Next action (unchanged): bounded, single-page investigation in authenticated Chrome (Rublev profile) for the camp URL (DOM + HEAD + console), then scoped reindex ONLY for `docs/moonn-five-page-reindex-urls-2026-05-21.txt` (+ sitemap); do not submit all 83 URLs.

## 2026-05-28 09:00 MSK — Supervisor Run: Five-Page SEO/AEO (Rendered Audit, DNS Blocked)

- Infra blocker (this host):
  - DNS resolution failed for `moonn.ru` (`Errno 11001 getaddrinfo failed`), so live HTTP/robots/sitemap/rendered checks are not comparable to previous days in this run.
- Local-only verification:
  - `assets/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-layer.js` exists in repo; commit `49a093e` exists in git object database.
- Next action: re-run the audit when DNS/network is restored, then proceed with the bounded authenticated-Chrome investigation for the camp AEO gap and scoped reindex for only the five URLs.

## 2026-05-30 09:00 MSK — Supervisor Run: Five-Page SEO/AEO (DNS Blocked, Fast-Fail Audit)

- Workstream: Moonn five-page SEO/AEO sprint supervisor (audit-only).

## 2026-05-29 09:00 MSK — Supervisor Run: Five-Page SEO/AEO (DNS Blocked, Fast-Fail Audit)

- Workstream: Moonn SEO-growth supervisor (audit-only, no live edits).
- Branch (canonical): `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Infra blocker (this host):
  - DNS resolution for `moonn.ru` is still broken (`[Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed`), so live HTTP/robots/sitemap/rendered checks are not comparable today.

- Change (tooling hardening):
  - Updated `scripts/moonn_five_page_seo_sprint_audit.py` to fast-fail when DNS is blocked, so the supervisor run cannot hang on network resolution failures.
- Analytics/GSC/Yandex-Webmaster:
  - No API exports and no GUI-verified aggregates were collected in this run (requires Rublev Chrome profile on a host with working DNS).
## 2026-05-26 09:00 MSK — Supervisor Run: SEO/AEO Daily Audit + Analytics Attempt

- Workstream: Moonn SEO-growth + privacy supervisor (audit-only, no live edits).
- Branch (canonical): `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Verified (low-risk):
  - Priority URLs HTTP `200`: `https://moonn.ru/`, `/events_tp`, `/lectures1`, `/psiholog-konsultacii-moskva`.
  - `https://moonn.ru/sitemap.xml` and `https://moonn.ru/robots.txt` HTTP `200`.

    - `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-05-26-rendered.md`
- Analytics (bounded GUI attempt):
  - Google Search Console and Yandex services prompted re-auth/identity confirmation in the opened sessions; no `2026-04-29..2026-05-26` aggregates were captured in this run.
- Persistent mismatch:
  - `https://moonn.ru/podrostkovyy-lager-psihologiya`: rendered answer block count remains `0` (expected `1` for the five-page sprint layer).
- Changed files:
  - `scripts/moonn_five_page_seo_sprint_audit.py` (timeouts so `--rendered` cannot hang indefinitely).

## 2026-05-25 12:00 MSK — Supervisor Run: SEO/AEO + Weekly Privacy Audit (Audit-Only)

- Workstream: Moonn SEO-growth + privacy/RKN supervisor (audit-only, no live edits).

    - Output: `docs/moonn-privacy-compliance-audit-2026-05-25.json`, `docs/moonn-privacy-compliance-audit-2026-05-25.md`.
- Verified (low-risk, from this host):
  - Priority URLs return HTTP `200`: `/`, `/events_tp`, `/lectures1`, `/psiholog-konsultacii-moskva`; `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` return `200`.
- Findings / blockers:
  - AEO regression persists: `https://moonn.ru/podrostkovyy-lager-psihologiya` rendered answer block count is `0` (expected `1` for the five-page sprint); requires authenticated Chrome DOM/HEAD inspection before any fix.
  - Privacy endpoints return `404`: `/privacy`, `/personal-data-consent`, `/cookies`, `/data-subject-request` (publication requires operator details confirmation + legal approval; no changes were made).
  - Audit flags `forms_without_detected_checkbox` broadly across the 83 URLs; treat as a verification task in Tilda templates (not a blind JS injection task).
- Notes:
  - No analytics exports/API evidence was collected in this run (Yandex.Metrika/Yandex Webmaster/GSC remain access-blocked here).

    - verified `assets/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-layer.js` exists
    - verified reindex scope file `docs/moonn-five-page-reindex-urls-2026-05-21.txt`
- Verified (this host):
  - DNS resolution for `moonn.ru` is still broken (`[Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed`), so live HTTP/robots/sitemap/raw HTML/rendered checks are not comparable today.
  - Repo canon still present (local-only): `assets/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-layer.js` exists; commit `49a093e` resolves in git.
- Updated artifacts:
  - `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-06-02.json`
  - `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-06-02.md`

  - `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-change-ledger-2026-05-21.json`
  - `docs/moonn-seo-growth-backlog.md`
- Explicitly not done:
  - no Tilda edits;
  - no GSC/Yandex Webmaster reindex submission;
  - no analytics claims from GSC/Yandex.Metrika;
  - no 83-URL batch submission.
- Next action: restore DNS/network or run on a host where `moonn.ru` resolves, then perform the bounded live audit and submit reindex only for the 5 approved URLs plus sitemap if GSC/Yandex access is available.

## 2026-06-02 09:10 MSK — Supervisor Run: Growth/Privacy Evidence (GUI + DNS Blocked Host)

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Workstream: `moonn-seo-privacy-supervisor`.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: scheduled morning supervisor run for SEO/AEO, analytics/growth and Monday privacy/RKN layer.
- Route:
  - current user-facing branch was unrelated (`codex/moonn-camp-page-update`);
  - supervisor work continued in the canonical SEO/RKN branch `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Ran:
  - `python scripts\\moonn_five_page_seo_sprint_audit.py --rendered`
  - `python scripts\\moonn_privacy_compliance_audit.py`
- Verified technical facts:
  - DNS for `moonn.ru` is still blocked on this host (`[Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed`), so the five-page audit and the privacy audit both fast-failed into dated evidence instead of live HTML checks.
  - New dated artifacts:
    - `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-06-02.json`
    - `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-06-02.md`
    - `docs/moonn-privacy-compliance-audit-2026-06-02.json`
    - `docs/moonn-privacy-compliance-audit-2026-06-02.md`
- Verified GUI evidence through the Alexander/Rublev Chrome profile:
  - Google Search Console property `https://moonn.ru/` is accessible.
  - GSC visible metrics:
    - overview: `240 total web search clicks`;
    - performance: `240` clicks, `14.5K` impressions, CTR `1.7%`, average position `7.3`;
    - data freshness: `Last update: 4 hours ago`;
    - overview indexing widget: `40 indexed pages`, `135 not indexed pages`.
  - Yandex.Metrika counter `96397286` is accessible.
  - Visible Metrika weekly dashboard metrics for `27 May - 2 Jun`:
    - `85` pageviews;
    - `53` visits;
    - `46` visitors;
    - `1 м 36 c` time on site;
    - depth `1.60`;
    - bounce rate `47.17%`.
- Blockers:
  - the requested full analytics period `2026-04-29..today` was not fully extracted yet;
  - Yandex.Webmaster direct Moonn dashboard attempt landed on a Yandex `404` page, so the canonical dashboard URL still needs to be recorded;
  - canonical MIIIIPS PR #11 repo+PR URL is still missing, so deploy/merge verification remains blocked.
- Explicitly not done:
  - no Tilda/live site edits;
  - no cabinet setting changes;
  - no screenshots saved or committed;
  - no 83-URL Google URL Inspection actions.
- New report/doc updates:
  - `docs/moonn-seo-growth-check-2026-06-02.md`
  - `docs/moonn-seo-growth-backlog.md`

## 2026-06-03 09:06 MSK — Supervisor Run: Five-Page SEO/AEO DNS-Blocked Audit

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Workstream: `moonn-five-page-seo-aeo-supervisor`.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: scheduled morning five-page SEO/AEO supervisor run.
- Route:
  - current user-facing branch was unrelated (`codex/moonn-camp-page-update`);
  - supervisor work was redirected back to the canonical branch `codex/moonn-seo-audit` before any changes.
- Ran:
  - `python scripts\moonn_five_page_seo_sprint_audit.py --packet docs/moonn-five-page-seo-packets-2026-05-21.json --rendered`
- Verified:
  - this host still cannot resolve `moonn.ru` (`[Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed`);
  - the dated audit wrote `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-06-03.{json,md}` and marked all 5 scoped URLs as `dns_blocked`;
  - `assets/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-layer.js` still exists locally;
  - git object `49a093e` still resolves;
  - approved reindex scope file `docs/moonn-five-page-reindex-urls-2026-05-21.txt` remains unchanged.
- Updated artifacts:
  - `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-06-03.json`
  - `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-06-03.md`
  - `docs/moonn-seo-growth-check-2026-06-03.md`
  - `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-change-ledger-2026-05-21.json`
  - `docs/moonn-seo-growth-backlog.md`
- Explicitly not done:
  - no Tilda edits;
  - no privacy/legal edits;
  - no GSC/Yandex Webmaster reindex submission;
  - no 83-URL batch submission;
  - no new GUI analytics collection beyond the already recorded `2026-06-02` evidence.
- Next action:
  - re-run the bounded live audit on a host where `moonn.ru` resolves, then submit reindex only for the approved five URLs plus sitemap if GSC/Yandex access is available.

## 2026-06-03 09:28 MSK — Supervisor Run: SEO/Growth GUI Fallback + Webmaster Route Recovery

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Workstream: `moonn-seo-privacy-supervisor`.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: scheduled morning supervisor run needed more than the DNS-blocked five-page audit; analytics and reindex follow-up were retried through the real Chrome profile.
- Route:
  - stayed on canonical branch `codex/moonn-seo-audit`;
  - used capability-router + GUI fallback because API/export evidence was still missing and DNS prevented normal live fetch checks.
- Verified technical facts:
  - local DNS for `moonn.ru` is still broken (`[Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed` / `Этот хост неизвестен. (moonn.ru:443)`), so live HTTP/sitemap/robots/rendered checks remain infra-blocked on this host;
  - temporary Chrome-profile clone did not preserve live cabinet auth, so the real visible Chrome window had to be used for GUI evidence.
- Verified via real `Alexander` Chrome window:
  - Google Search Console property `https://moonn.ru/` is accessible;
  - GSC Performance currently shows `245` clicks, `14.6K` impressions, CTR `1.7%`, average position `7.4`, last update `3.5 hours ago`;
  - visible top queries include `татьяна мунн`, `дневник эмоций как вести`, `дневник эмоций`, `как вести дневник эмоций`;
  - GSC Overview currently shows `40 indexed pages`, `135 not indexed pages`, `22` HTTPS pages, `25` valid Breadcrumb enhancements.
- Verified via real `Alexander` Chrome window in Yandex.Metrika:
  - counter `96397286` is accessible;
  - visible weekly slice `28 мая - 3 июн` shows `105` pageviews, `78` visits, `69` visitors, `1 м 4 c` time on site, depth `1,35`, bounce `58,97%`;
  - visible sources: direct `66`, search `10`, referral `1`, messengers `1`;
  - visible top-page tables now include supervisor/test querystrings such as `?payment-click-audit=20260602`, `?hero-live-check=20260602-2`, `?verify=20260603-*`, which should be treated as a measurement-quality incident.
- Verified via real `Alexander` Chrome window in Yandex.Webmaster:
  - canonical Moonn reindex route is `https://webmaster.yandex.ru/site/https:moonn.ru:443/indexing/reindex/`;
  - the old guessed `/sites/...` route was wrong;
  - visible priority URL statuses on the reindex page:
    - `https://moonn.ru/` — `Заявка обработана`, `08.05.2026 9:20`, `Уже отслеживается`;
    - `https://moonn.ru/events_tp` — `Заявка обработана`, `08.05.2026 9:20`;
    - `https://moonn.ru/lectures1` — `Заявка обработана`, `08.05.2026 9:20`;
    - `https://moonn.ru/psiholog-konsultacii-moskva` — `Заявка обработана`, `08.05.2026 9:20`.
- Updated artifacts:
  - `docs/moonn-seo-growth-check-2026-06-03.md`
  - `docs/moonn-seo-growth-backlog.md`
- Explicitly not done:
  - no Tilda edits;
  - no privacy/legal publication;
  - no cabinet settings changes;
  - no screenshots saved or committed;
  - no 83-URL Google URL Inspection actions.
- Next action:
  - capture the exact custom period `2026-04-29..2026-06-03` in GSC and Metrika, collect 4 priority URL Inspection statuses in GSC, and decide how to exclude QA querystring traffic from Metrika growth reads.

## 2026-06-03 MSK — `мунн.рф` Analytics Migration Routing

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Workstream: Moonn SEO / analytics-domain-migration.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- User correction:
  - Do not create a new unrelated branch for this task.
  - Continue in the branch where the supervisor automations and their evidence are already recorded.
- Routing result:
  - `codex/moonn-seo-audit` is the canonical branch for the SEO supervisor and automation evidence.
  - `codex/moonn-rf-domain-continuity` contains prior domain-continuity facts for `мунн.рф`, but the active analytics/supervisor continuation belongs in `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Decisions:
  - Treat `https://мунн.рф/` as the current live domain.
  - Treat `https://moonn.ru/` as legacy/historical analytics unless new-domain property evidence is verified.
  - Treat `moon.ru` as a wrong unrelated domain.
- Changed artifacts:
  - `scripts/moonn_five_page_seo_sprint_audit.py` — added `--base-url`.
  - `scripts/moonn_privacy_compliance_audit.py` — added `--base-url`.
  - `data/site.json` — current brand domain changed to `мунн.рф`.
  - `docs/moonn-rf-analytics-migration-2026-06-03.md`
  - `docs/moonn-rf-analytics-migration-2026-06-03.json`
  - `docs/moonn-rf-five-page-reindex-urls-2026-06-03.txt`
  - `docs/moonn-seo-growth-backlog.md`
- Verification:
  - `python -m py_compile scripts\moonn_five_page_seo_sprint_audit.py scripts\moonn_privacy_compliance_audit.py` passed.
  - `python scripts\moonn_five_page_seo_sprint_audit.py --packet docs\moonn-five-page-seo-packets-2026-05-21.json --base-url https://мунн.рф --out-prefix moonn-rf-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-06-03` passed and wrote the dated new-domain audit.
  - Five scoped URLs on `мунн.рф` return HTTP `200`, DNS resolves, and robots do not block them.
  - New blockers found: scoped URLs are not detected in `https://мунн.рф/sitemap.xml`; all five show `canonical_mismatch`.
  - Privacy smoke check for `мунн.рф` passed technically with `--max-urls 8`, but policy endpoints return `404` and first 8 checked URLs still show `forms_without_detected_checkbox`.
- Open blocker:
  - External Google Search Console, Yandex.Webmaster, Yandex.Metrika and Google Analytics settings require authenticated cabinet confirmation before reporting them as created or changed.

## 2026-06-05 10:58 MSK — Supervisor Run: `мунн.рф` live audit + GSC property blocker

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Workstream: `moonn-five-page-seo-aeo-supervisor`.
- Branch: `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: scheduled morning supervisor run with the current live-domain contract for `мунн.рф`.
- Route:
  - the open repo copy stayed on an unrelated branch/worktree, so supervisor work continued in the canonical worktree for `codex/moonn-seo-audit`;
  - live checks used `https://xn--l1acaw.xn--p1ai/` technically and reported results as `мунн.рф`.
- Ran:
  - `python scripts\moonn_five_page_seo_sprint_audit.py --packet docs\moonn-five-page-seo-packets-2026-05-21.json --rendered --base-url https://xn--l1acaw.xn--p1ai --out-prefix moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-06-05`
- Verified:
  - DNS for `xn--l1acaw.xn--p1ai` resolves on this host;
  - all 5 scoped `мунн.рф` URLs return HTTP `200`;
  - `https://xn--l1acaw.xn--p1ai/sitemap.xml` contains all 5 scoped URLs in this run;
  - `robots.txt` does not block the 5 scoped URLs;
  - all 5 pages still expose `canonical_mismatch` to legacy `https://moonn.ru/...`;
  - camp page rendered answer block is still `0`, while the other 4 pages render `1`;
  - raw placeholders remain on camp and gallery pages; missing raw image `alt` remains across all 5 pages;
  - local canon is still intact: `assets/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-layer.js` exists and git object `49a093e` resolves.
- GUI-only verification:
  - in the real `Alexander` Chrome profile, opening the GSC route for `sc-domain:xn--l1acaw.xn--p1ai` showed `Oops, you don't have access to this property`;
  - therefore new-domain GSC property access is blocked in this run and traffic migration is not proven.
- Updated artifacts:
  - `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-06-05.json`
  - `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-06-05.md`
  - `docs/moonn-seo-growth-check-2026-06-05.md`
  - `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-change-ledger-2026-05-21.json`
  - `docs/moonn-seo-growth-backlog.md`
- Explicitly not done:
  - no Tilda edits;
  - no canonical rewrites;
  - no privacy/legal edits;
  - no GSC/Yandex reindex submission;
  - no 83-URL batch actions;
  - no cabinet settings changes.
- Next action:
  - fix native Tilda canonical on the five scoped pages, inspect the camp AEO block on `мунн.рф`, and only then request scoped reindex after `мунн.рф` property access is confirmed in GSC/Yandex.

## 2026-05-25 09:00 MSK — Supervisor Run: Five-Page SEO/AEO (Rendered Audit + Persistent AEO Gap)

- Workstream: Moonn five-page SEO/AEO sprint supervisor (audit-only).
- Branch (canonical): `codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Ran (rendered): `python scripts\\moonn_five_page_seo_sprint_audit.py --rendered`.
  - Output: `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-05-25.json`, `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-05-25.md`.
- Verified (from this host):
  - All five URLs: HTTP `200`, sitemap listed, robots not blocked.
  - Rendered H1 count: `1` on all five URLs.
- Persistent mismatch (P0):
  - `https://moonn.ru/podrostkovyy-lager-psihologiya` rendered answer block count is `0` again (expected `1` for the sprint AEO layer).
- Known issues (unchanged):
  - Raw placeholder strings remain on camp/gallery pages.
  - Missing raw image `alt` remains across all five pages.
- Next action (unchanged): scoped reindex submission only for `docs/moonn-five-page-reindex-urls-2026-05-21.txt` (+ sitemap) via GSC/Yandex Webmaster API or authenticated Chrome GUI; do not submit all 83 URLs.

## 2026-06-06 12:10 MSK — Supervisor Run: `мунн.рф` live audit, packet drift, new-domain cabinet blockers

- Project: Moonn / Tatyana Munn site.
- Workstream: Moonn SEO/privacy supervisor.
- Routing:
  - current checkout in this chat was `codex/moonn-camp-page-update`, so it was treated as unrelated;
  - canonical `codex/moonn-seo-audit` was occupied by another worktree;
  - this run continued in isolated branch `codex/moonn-seo-supervisor-20260606` from `origin/codex/moonn-seo-audit`.
- Trigger: daily morning supervisor run with live domain canon `https://мунн.рф/`.
- Ran:
  - `python scripts\moonn_five_page_seo_sprint_audit.py --packet docs\moonn-five-page-seo-packets-2026-05-21.json --rendered --base-url https://xn--l1acaw.xn--p1ai --out-prefix moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-06-06`
  - browser-like HEAD checks for `/`, `/events_tp`, `/lectures1`, `/psiholog-konsultacii-moskva`, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`
- Verified:
  - all listed live `мунн.рф` URLs above returned HTTP `200`;
  - `ddos-guard` is now in front of the site, so naive headless requests can produce false `403` noise while browser-like requests still return `200`;
  - five packetized pages returned `200`, are in sitemap, and are not robots-blocked;
  - rendered H1 count is `1` on all five packetized pages;
  - camp page rendered answer block is still `0`;
  - camp page canonical now self-points to `https://xn--l1acaw.xn--p1ai/podrostkovyy-lager-psihologiya`;
  - but the same camp page now mismatches the old packet title/description, because the live page was reworked from `лагерь` into `интенсив`;
  - the other four packet pages still canonicalize to `https://moonn.ru/...`.
- GUI-only cabinet checks in the real `Alexander` Chrome profile:
  - GSC for `sc-domain:xn--l1acaw.xn--p1ai` still shows `Oops, you don't have access to this property`;
  - Yandex.Webmaster for `https://xn--l1acaw.xn--p1ai` shows `Сайт ... вам не принадлежит. Добавьте его в список ваших сайтов и подтвердите права...`;
  - active Metrika session was already sitting inside an unsaved goal-creation modal, so no metric-navigation clicks were performed and no new aggregates were collected.
- New insight:
  - the camp lane is now a mixed state: real AEO blocker (`answer block = 0`) plus stale supervisor contract (`packet still expects old лагерь metadata`);
  - future runs should not report this as one undifferentiated regression.
- Changed artifacts:
  - `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-06-06.json`
  - `docs/moonn-five-page-seo-sprint-audit-2026-06-06.md`
  - `docs/moonn-seo-growth-check-2026-06-06.md`
  - `docs/moonn-seo-growth-backlog.md`
- Explicitly not done:
  - no Tilda edits;
  - no GSC/Yandex verification clicks;
  - no Metrika settings interactions;
  - no privacy publication work;
  - no 83-URL actions.
