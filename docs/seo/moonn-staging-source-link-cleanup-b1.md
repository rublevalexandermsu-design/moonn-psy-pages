# Moonn Staging Source Link Cleanup Batch 1

Generated: 2026-05-02T11:10:00+03:00

## Scope

- Project: `Moonn Staging` / Tilda project `25075076`.
- Purpose: test source-level cleanup of repeated link defects on copied Tilda pages before applying the same operation to production `moonn.ru`.
- API role: read/export verification only. Official Tilda API does not expose block editing methods, so source changes must be made in the Tilda editor and then verified by export.

## Current Staging Audit

- Pages checked: `148`.
- Pages with known link issues: `60`.
- `http_wa`: `90`.
- `bad_domain`: `39`.
- `bad_plus_wa`: `0`.
- `internalized_bad_plus_wa`: `0`.

## Edit Contract

For each page in the batch:

1. Pass the Tilda browser session gate below.
2. Open the staging page editor, not production.
3. Replace `http://wa.me/79777770303` with `https://wa.me/79777770303`.
4. Replace `http://.moonn.ru` with `https://moonn.ru`.
5. Save and publish the staging page.
6. Re-export the page through Tilda API and require both old-pattern counters to become `0`.
7. Only after the staging batch passes, apply the same page/block pattern to production pages.

## Tilda Browser Session Gate

Before any Tilda save or publish action:

1. Visible browser URL must be on `tilda.ru`, not `timepad.ru`, `moonn.ru`, or the staging public domain.
2. The Tilda account must already be authenticated; login pages and `tilda.ru/404/pagenotpublished/` do not pass.
3. The editor/project context must show staging project `25075076` / `Moonn Staging`, not production project `8326812`.
4. The active page id must match the current batch row.
5. If any of these checks fail, stop before editing and restore the correct Tilda session.

Current blocked state, 2026-05-02:

- Visible desktop Chrome window is on `TimePad.ru`, not Tilda.
- Browser Use in-app tab opens the direct staging editor URL as `https://tilda.ru/404/pagenotpublished/`.
- No staging page source edits were made in this session after the audit.

Resolved browser route, 2026-05-02:

- Correct browser route for Tilda UI work: regular Google Chrome profile `Profile 5` / `Alexander`.
- Do not use Browser Use's isolated in-app tab for authenticated Tilda editing unless it is explicitly re-authenticated.
- Do not use Chrome `Profile 3` for this workstream; it opens Tilda as an unauthenticated session.

## Staging Page Check: `psiholog-konsultacii-moskva`

- Page id: `138661976`.
- Live staging URL: `https://carry-pacific-flatfish.tilda.ws/psiholog-konsultacii-moskva`.
- Action completed: opened the page in the correct Chrome `Profile 5` / `Alexander`, saved the visible content panel, and published the staging page.
- Verification after publish:
  - `http://wa.me/79777770303`: still `1`.
  - `http://twa.me/79777770303`: also present as an additional typo not counted in the first audit.
  - `http://.moonn.ru`: `0`.
- Root cause update:
  - The visible top card block is already updated and links internally to `#rec2173806101` / `#rec...`.
  - The remaining defects are in lower legacy duplicated blocks, not in the first visible card block:
    - `rec2224930001`: `http://wa.me/79777770303`.
    - `rec2224930061`: `http://twa.me/79777770303`.
- Follow-up rule:
  - Before editing a Tilda page with repeated blocks, verify the exact live `rec` id from current staging HTML, then scroll to that block in the editor. Do not assume the first visually similar block is the defective one.

## UI Incident

- Symptom: while preparing the first staging UI edit, manual pointer automation switched focus to an unrelated Chrome/Timepad tab.
- Root cause: the current visible Chrome session contains several active browser tabs/windows, and coordinate-based clicks are too easy to misroute for mass edits.
- Rule: before mass Tilda UI edits, open a dedicated Chrome window/tab for one Tilda project and verify the address/project breadcrumb before every save/publish action.
